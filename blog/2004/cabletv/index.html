<p>So why am I addicted to Cable TV? Honestly, it probably isn’t watched in my home nearly as often as in most homes across the country. Yet it is watched, and why?</p>

<p>Perhaps because my only television news source is The Daily Show. I admit it. Now I’m not taking all edited news clips on the show as true fact. Yet the show spurs me on to Google articles on various topics. With the state of network news these days, is The Daily Show really an evil alternative?</p>

<p>OK, so I need to watch the Twins almost daily as well. Isn’t that something I can cut out? Does one really need to see all 162 games of a baseball season?</p>

<p>That does it. I’m cutting myself off. Well, maybe after the Twins season. Seriously.</p>
