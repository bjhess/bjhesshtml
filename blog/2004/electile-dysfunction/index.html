      <h1>
        Electile Dysfunction
      </h1>





<p>I went to The Brave New Workshop’s election show last night with a couple friends. It was clearly the least enjoyable election show I’ve been to in the 5 years I’ve been frequenting BNW. The satire wasn’t particularly biting as the writers chose to stay more on a superficial level. The contentious issues of Vietnam service, war mistakes, and domestic spending were relegated to a few one-liners.</p>

<p>As judged by the size and fervor of the crowd, BNW has probably made a good choice. They still aren’t going to draw a lot of Bush backers, but those who prefer their politics more moderate would also be pretty entertained by the show. Don’t get me wrong, this show wasn’t the least enjoyable of BNW’s strongly political shows. That award would probably be unanimously given to The Governator.</p>
