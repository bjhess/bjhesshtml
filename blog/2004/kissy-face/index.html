        Kissy Face
      </h1>





<p>Thank goodness I finally saw it with my own eyes. Plastered on all three prominent sides of a moving van-sized truck.</p>
<blockquote>Two men kissing.  "Want gay marriage?  Vote Democrat in November."</blockquote>
<p>Huh? It is hard to believe, but I’m sure this campaigning actually works. So gay men have been waiting until they could get married to kiss? Once gay marriage is deemed legal they are going to be kissing all over <strong>in public</strong>. Ironically this ad digs to the very core of what the issue is all about. Men’s men get just oh so many creep-crawlies on them if they see men kissing. Just like they do when they see black men kissing white women.</p>

<p>I really hope the next step is an aborted fetus driving down the street. My life will be complete when I see that.</p>
