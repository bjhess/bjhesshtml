      <h1>
        Last Day of Class
      </h1>





<p>I finished my class today. I still have a short story to turn in next Tuesday, but that shouldn’t be a problem.</p>

<p>Today’s class was pretty decent. The one more distracting class member was gone, which made the class much more open in discussion. People who hadn’t talked during the previous month were offering opinions. I do regret what could have been on this front.</p>

<p>Several people read their short story rough drafts today. I was asked to go last. I was pleased with the response as I heard several people let out semi-surprised “oh’s.” One person even said “great story” immediately after I finished reading.</p>

<p>I may post the story on my site after it goes through a couple more drafts.</p>
