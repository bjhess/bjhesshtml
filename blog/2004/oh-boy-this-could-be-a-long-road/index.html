        Oh Boy, This Could Be a Long Road
      </h1>





      <p>Can anyone explain to me why the heck I would ever need to start blogging? Web logging? Anyone?</p>

      <p>I guess the goal I have is just to keep honing those all important writing and communication skills.
        Additionally, I think this blog/journal will help me to retain thoughts and opinions over time.</p>

      <p>There really isnâ€™t going to be a specific focus on this blog. Short posts, medium posts, long posts. Whatever.
