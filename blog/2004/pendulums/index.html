        Pendulums

<p><em>We are like pendulums<br>Our arms swinging at our sides<br>And I am a good little clock<br>Walking along, paralyzed<br> <br>I'm thinking like a swinging door<br>I'm hinging on these changing thoughts<br>Between the pull up to the shore<br>And the push off</em></p>

<p>–Sarah Harmer</p>

<p>I saw <a href="http://www.sarahharmer.com/">Sarah Harmer</a> live preceding a <a href="http://barenakedladies.com/">Barenaked Ladies</a> concert a few years ago. She was the first opening act, even before <a href="http://www.proclaimers.co.uk/2003/">The Proclaimers</a> (“I would walk 500 miles” cum Shrek). Of course, the crowd was antsy having not even known there were three acts to sit through; the ticket only mentioned two. I not-listened along with everyone else, but her set ended with a haunting song, “Lodestar.” The song was a story with beautiful imagery accompanied by a muted trumpet.</p>

<p>Somehow I actually got the song downloaded a month or two later (excerpt below). Until recently, this was the only song I had ever listened to from Harmer. That changed as I downloaded her newest album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001GOHAC/bjhesscom-20?dev-t=D19SL3MIFFPEJU%26camp=2025%26link_code=sp1">All of Our Names</a>. Very good stuff. A purchase is forthcoming.</p>

<p>And again this reminds me of the female artist renaissance that occurred in my life several years ago. Previously I just never latched on to any female singers/songwriters. Then came Lauryn Hill, leading to Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, Nelly Furtado, Nellie McKay, etc. Some of my favorite musicians are now women, and I’m not complaining.</p>
