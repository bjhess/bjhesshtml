        Powerline

<p>Am I missing something here?</p>

<p>The folks at Powerline seem to be reaching pretty far to <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/008982.php">display liberal bias</a>. The “Democrats, especially the Democrats in the press, want to demonstrate that they are still in charge” by pressing this autopen controversy. Imagine my surprise when I clicked on the politics section of several liberal newspapers’ online editions and didn’t find a single headline reference to this controversy. Of course, I don’t count every Rummy story that includes a passing reference to the autopen. How many newspapers does Google news hit? I wonder if each was counted once for releasing the initial story how close to 800 Google news hits we’d be? Doesn’t sound like pen-gate to me.</p>

<p>This is where Powerline loses me. I’m fine with wearing your politics on your sleeve. I would be completely interested in a well-written source of conservative thought, and I imagine at times they fit this bill, especially in the economic realm. But to me it seems like they are more pundits than anything else. (I say this trying to avoid a complete blanket statement.) Yes, it is an improvement to have links to stories and such, an improvement I ultimately attribute to the medium, but it still comes down to a series of posts often preaching to the choir. They aren’t convincing me of anything. Why else would the autopen merit so much of their “ink?”</p>

<p>Is it coincidence that the Rumsfeld critique didn’t boil to the top until conservative politicos started weighing in on the situation? Or did the Democratic press machine force them into it? It seems this is inevitably leading to postings that John McCain isn’t a conservative and never shall be. The overly simplistic claim that Democrats, which must be interpreted as fairly all-inclusive, share the view that the entire Iraq war was a mistake is a dangerous claim to make. To me it is also dangerous to assume the President is making decisions based on the concept that Democrats “[hope] for Iraq to turn into Vietnam.” It’s a sad scenario to think the President won’t fire a man who has undermined his potential success in Iraq simply because he believes the firing will imply an overall mistake. It paints a picture of a cowardly man, a man Powerline supports without reserve.</p>

<p>To step further out, my goal is to determine if I’ll ever read the Powerline blog again. I’ve tried on multiple occasions and recoiled each time. I find it interesting that the first post of the day is about the autopen, a non-issue according to their extensive preceeding posts. The autopen post included rosy remarks about the state of Iraq’s upcoming elections. No reference to the three dead voting officials in the news this morning, though due to the “bias” I had a remarkably hard time finding an <a href="http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/news/nation/10464593.htm">article</a> about it.</p>

<p>And how can I take them seriously when they consistently talk about Democrats and terrorists <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/008929.php#008929">in the same breath</a> (bottom paragraph) and also think Bill Maher is one of the more <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/008977.php">annoying liberals</a>?</p>

<p>Again, I don’t wish to blanket these guys with the things I’ve seen in my limited reading, but I also don’t want to expend the energy to find what is useful in their writing, and so my decision is made.</p>
