      <h1>
        The Full Maria
      </h1>





<p>A couple days ago I watched the US/Columbian flick <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390221/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9bWFyaWEgZnVsbCBvZiBncmFjZXxodG1sPTF8bm09b24_;fc=1;ft=2"><em>Maria Full of Grace</em></a>. I’m not really sure of its true country of origin. A US writer and director put the movie together, but everything from there is decidedly Columbian. When you think that a US artist oversaw this, you have to be at least a little impressed. Well given my point-of-view anyway.</p>

<p>I certainly expected something more gritty from a drug mule story (with that context, you can see how great the movie’s US title is) of sorta Latin American origin. After recently watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317248/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxzZz0xfHR0PW9ufHBuPTB8cT1jaXR5IG9mIGdvZHxteD0yMHxsbT0yMDB8aHRtbD0xfG5tPW9u;fc=1;ft=16"><em>City of God</em></a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245712/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9YW1vcmVzIHBlcnJvc3xodG1sPTF8bm09b24_;fc=1;ft=3"><em>Amores Perros</em></a>, that expectation was reasonable if not more than a little stereotypical on my part. What I found in this movie is a more human story of one girl making several difficult choices with the future of her unborn child in my mind.</p>

<p>The movie didn’t have as profound of an affect on me given its less grainy presentation. Maybe I should give the film credit for this decision. The movie also <em>flew</em> by, which is honestly a rare occurence from my foreign movie watching experience. It clocked in around 105 minutes, but felt more like 75.</p>

<p>I’d personally rate at around 4 out of 5 stars. Don’t run out and see it, but consider it as a rental at some point.</p>
