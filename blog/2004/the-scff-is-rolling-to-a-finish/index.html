        The SCFF Is Rolling to a Finish
      </h1>





      <p>I spent my last night at the <strong>S</strong>teele <strong>C</strong>ounty <strong>F</strong>ree
        <strong>F</strong>air tonight. Ah the wonder of frying things that have already been fried. Yes, bacon fried
        bacon is in effect.</p>

      <p>Imagine lightly frying some bacon. Then batter it and fry it again - probably in the bacon fat from the
        previous frying session. Then pour some maple syrup and powdered sugar on top. OK, so it sounds wondrous, but in
        reality it is just OK. First couple chunks were good, but a whole serving was not necessary for me.</p>

      <p>So on to washing down the bacon with a bison burger and Cinnie Minnies. Miniature cinnamon roles with cream
        cheese dipping frosting are the most amazingly beautiful thing in creation. Trust me.</p>
