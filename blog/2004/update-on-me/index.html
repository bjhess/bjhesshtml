      <h1>
        Update on Me
      </h1>





      <p>Our family has had a pretty busy time of it this past month. A parade of weddings saw us invited to couplings
        five times in the last four weekends. We made it to what we could and actually even had a good time at a few of
        the parties.</p>

      <p>Daughter is starting to get a tooth. She is also learning a few things here and there. It’s pretty interesting,
        as I typed this she learned to turn her musical device in her crib on and off for the first time.</p>

      <p>Work has picked up in October. Thankfully the Twins exited the playoffs quickly, which took the stress of
        trying to get to games out of the picture. I am now juggling a class schedule, Jesse’s work schedule, and work
        with any opportunities for personal entertainment.</p>

      <p>The class schedule is in reference to a Fiction Creative Writing class I am taking at <a href="http://www.riverland.cc.mn.us/">Riverland Community College</a> here in Owatonna. The class has been a
        mixed bag so far. It is only one credit, thus low $$$‘s. It has achieved my minimum criterion for success, which
        was generating some sort of writing out of me.</p>

      <p>The basic output of the course is a short story, and what I am working on looks to be pretty decent. The class
        is mostly 19-year-olds and they are patently uninterested in it. There is also very little background; just
        write! (The exclamation is not meant to imply this as a good thing)</p>

      <p>With any luck the writing in this class will inspire me to participate in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">nanowrimo</a> more so than in the past. I think I got out about 2,000 words
        last time. Not impressive.</p>
