        Wyoming and Me
      </h1>





<p>Tired.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning I’ll be leaving Owatonna at 4AM to catch a 7AM flight to Denver. I’m looking forward to a nap in Cheyenne tomorrow afternoon to prepare me for the long night.</p>

<p>The reason for the trip is to see <a href="http://caseous.com/author.html">Nate</a>. A few weeks ago he mentioned his Caseous Company is doing their <a href="http://caseous.com/caseouscompany.html">holiday sketch show</a> and I should come out. Surprisingly the timing was appropriate and the cost was do-able. If you live in Minneapolis and have close friends or relatives in the Denver area, there are really no excuses for you not to visit them. Round trip flights to Denver are rarely greater than $200. Also, the flight is short enough that a long weekend is very appropriate.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am excited to go out and see Nate’s show, which was hilarious when I attended last year, and most of all see Nate. He will be moving on to either San Francisco, Florida, or Mankato (seriously!) next year, so I don’t really know what that means for our bi-annual visits in the future.</p>

<p>Other exciting things in my life?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Work is going OK still.  I was promoted to Senior Programmer/Analyst at the end of November.  From what I've seen since starting at my company, I was promote quite early.  On the other hand, I feel I've been doing the work of the position for about eighteen months now.</li>
  <li>Ava has her two bottom front teeth.  Now her top fang teeth are coming in.  Is it wrong of me to hope that she just has those four teeth for a while?  What I'm picturing in my mind is incredibly funny.</li>
  <li>I'm unreasonably excited by the fact that I'm getting my bowling ball filled and drilled into a finger-tip grip this week.  I will then start learning to throw a hook.  Seems like a lot to expect from someone who bowls once every two weeks in the winter months.</li>
  <li>Oh, and Ava is crawling now.  The good side is that she is much happier since she can get around.  The bad side is that she can get around.</li>
</ul>
