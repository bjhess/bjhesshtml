      <h1>
        You've Been Drafted
      </h1>





<p>Once again I’ve kicked off the NFL season with my first fantasy draft. As per usual, I have the best team going into the season. This will likely result in a 6-8 record and no playoff birth.</p>

<p>Stupid head-to-head fantasy football is the reason I’ve become a huge fan of rotisserie leagues. They focus more on full season results and not week-to-week luck of the draw. At least that’s what I tell myself. Anyway, it seems research time garners a lot more predictable results in rotisserie.</p>

<p>Team HHH/Triple H/Hesston Happy Hounds will rule the roost again, and I’m not ashamed to admit it. The playoffs are my goal and I aim to please.</p>
