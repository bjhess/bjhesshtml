        89.3 the Current
      </h1>

      
    


<p>Be sure to check out the new public radio station on <a href="http://www.publicradio.org/columns/minnesota/conversation/">89.3, The Current</a>.</p>

<p>I listened to it for about 15 minutes today and I’ve already been impressed. After lunch I got to listen to <a href="http://www.pinback.com/">Pinback</a>‘s “AFK”…on the radio. What?!?</p>

<p>I think in the morning they were playing Luna and Wilco. I suppose I should reserve judgement for a while, but I like what I hear so far. I may need to re-up my MPR membership in the spring because of this. I imagine it will give me a taste of what satellite radio could provide: very few commercial interruptions.</p>

<p>From what I gathered on MPR’s news station yesterday, this station is broadcasting out of Minneapolis and Rochester.</p>
