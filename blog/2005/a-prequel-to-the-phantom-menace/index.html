        A Prequel to the Phantom Menace?
      </h1>





<p>Like you didn’t think it would happen.</p>
<blockquote>...the tales of the Jedi regaining control of the universe from the many Dark Lords some 88 years before Anakin Skywalker's bowl cut ever graced the earth. </blockquote>
<p>Fans will decry this idea. I love it. Regardless of the “badness” of the first two movies, they are fun and unmatched in cinema. It’s amazing to me that no one has really tried to do the same thing Lucas did in Star Wars. After all these years. Nobody has created this entire vast universe (I don’t think of “Alien” as a vast universe).</p>

<p>There has been a cottage industry around Star Wars for decades, creating books and games that built up its “extended universe.” I’ve never really gotten into any of this, but I am finding that when these projects are done well they are greatly entertaining. I’m currently playing through Knights of the Old Republic on PC and having a ball.</p>

<p>When Episode III ended, I knew there would be plenty more Star Wars in my future. I wasn’t sure how it would be done, but I felt that even after Lucas died someone would be allowed to continue with his intellectual property.</p>

<p>Pure speculation on my part, but who wouldn’t want to see Peter Jackson take up an entirely new and separate trilogy story in a decade and see it through to completion? The man idolizes George Lucas. The only real sticky point I see is that he’d want to release the movies three years in a row rather than every three years like Lucas. Oh, and he wouldn’t want to use Industrial Light-Magic.</p>
