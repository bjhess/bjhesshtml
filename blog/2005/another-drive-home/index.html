      <h1>
        Another Drive Home
      </h1>





<p>Thankfully after a horrendous two hour drive to the cities tonight, the drive home was much less eventful. I was able to listen to a few great tunes again on the drive. I’m starting to think I should start a “goose bump” playlist to see if I force myself into a ditch with all the musical goodness. (And all this after having hair standing up on my neck to <a href="http://www.dci.org/news/news.cfm?news_id=934127b5-26f6-4115-9ba0-ad8d4cbf8046">the strains</a> of <a href="http://www.cookgroup.com/star/history/rec4.html">Star '91</a>, Regiment ‘96, and Cavaliers ‘02.)</p>

<p>Particularly, four songs did the number on me tonight. <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:1s620rnac48c">Bill Withers</a>‘ “I Wish You Well” and “My Imagination.” The toss up for most effective was between <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:4srz281c053a">Sting</a>’s “I Hung My Head” and “I Was Brought to My Senses,” both from the outstanding album <em>Mercury Falling</em>. Tonight the winner is “I Hung My Head.” I’ll readily admit that “I Was Brought to My Senses” is a superior song, but Sting’s outstanding storytelling had me this time:</p>
<blockquote>Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on a hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim

My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head and my hands

The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the court house
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in the chair
Explain to the court room
What went through you mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find

I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on a hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain

And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'd ride together
To kingdom come
I prayed for god's mercy
For soon I'd be dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I hung my head
I hung my head</blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:dxkvikp6bbo9">Johnny Cash</a> covered “I Hung My Head” on <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:7ztqoauawijp"><em>American IV: The Man Comes Around</em></a>. Judging from how I liked his cover of <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:m95h8qptbtq4">NIN</a>‘s “Hurt,” I may have to give it a try.</p>
