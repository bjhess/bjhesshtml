        Balls Out - Dock Ellis
      </h1>





<p><a href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/Issues/2005-06-16/news/feature.html">Very interesting article</a>. Note: the language is rated R.</p>

<p>He pitched a no-hitter on acid (among other drugs):</p>
<blockquote>Ellis remained calm. The game would start late. Ample time for the acid to wear off. Then it struck him: doubleheader. The Pirates had a doubleheader. And he was pitching the first game. He had four hours to get to San Diego [from LA], warm up and pitch. If something didn't happen in the interim, Dock Philip Ellis, age 25, was about to enter a 50,000-seat stadium and throw a very small ball, very hard, for a very long time, without the benefit of being able to, you know, feel the thing.</blockquote>
<p>He used the hit batsmen to his advantage:</p>
<blockquote>When the Cincinnati Reds taunted the Pirates after beating them in the 1972 National League Championship Series, Ellis decided to motivate his team by hitting every single batter in the Reds' lineup. He hit the first three and walked two before he was pulled. He had, in short, that certain combination of raw talent and insanity that very rarely creates Hall of Famers but almost always creates legends.</blockquote>
<p>In fact, he pitched every game in his career on drugs:</p>
<blockquote>...by the time he arrived on the Pirates proper, Ellis was popping green Dexamyl pills before every game. Eventually, he'd need between 70 and 85 milligrams to get up for a start; that would be somewhere between five and 12 pills, depending on what type he took. And over the next 12 years, he wouldn't pitch a single major league game without them. Not one.</blockquote>
