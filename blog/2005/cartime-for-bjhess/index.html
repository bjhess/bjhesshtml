<p>The Jetta has been purchased.</p>

<p>After looking online for Volkswagen Jetta GLS’s TDI’s (diesel) for the past month, I had finally given up. The car was so difficult to find. Once found, it would sell in one or two days. See, I wanted to replace my <a href="http://bjhess.com/b2blog/index.php/a/2005/03/18/snoooooooooooooowwwww">truck</a>, and it would be a great fit to get a 45 mpg diesel with my wife commuting 37 miles one way to work twice a week. I was also marginally hopeful that our family of three could drive this the 3 hours one way back to our parents town relatively consistently.</p>

<p>Yes, I had given up. In looking for a vehicle to replace the truck, I was hoping for one of two needs to be met. Extreme efficiency or large cargo capacity. Our other car is a ‘99 Olds Intrigue, which we’ve found is slightly too small at times. We’re getting by, but we could see need down the road.</p>

<p>So off we went to meet <a href="http://premium.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=pharmer01">Luke</a> and go car shopping along I-394. Specifically we were going to look at the Subaru Outback, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, and possibly a Nissan Maxima or Honda Accord for good measure. We didn’t need a Suburban or anything, just a little more size.</p>

<p>First dealership; one OK looking, terribly beaten on used Outback under our belt, Luke swings us into Sears Imports promosing a “decent selection of used cars.” Sears is a Mercedes/BMW dealership, and I didn’t like my odds. Luckily Luke wasn’t slowing down to let me get a good look at any BMW’s.</p>

<p>Brakes slam. “Jetta TDI!”</p>

<p>I look. A year newer than I’d like, but less miles than I was planning on taking. Hmmm…</p>

<p>I drive. Smoother than expected. More solidly built than I expected. Nearly 100% loaded. Mmmm…</p>

<p>Needless to say, a couple drives later and my truck is long gone. The Jetta is purchased and we’ve loved it so far. Drove it home this weekend for Easter. It was a much more comfortable ride than our usual interstate jaunt. Very pleased.</p>

<p>And imagine our surprise when the trunk held nearly as much as the Olds Intrigue. Turns out taking more than three minutes to design a trunk pays off. Our initial reaction is that the trunk holds more, but I’m guessing under close scrutiny we’d be wrong. Oldsmobile <strong>very</strong> generously lists their trunk capacity at 16.7 cubic feet versus the Jetta sedan at 13.0 cubic feet. That’s a blatant lie.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to the day when biodiesel is available in Owatonna for a reasonable price. For all I know it is right now. I would love to be 100% off the OPEC bandwagon. Too bad our president doesn’t agree.</p>

<p>Luke and I are discussing a Maxima/Jetta polishing and picture taking party. When this happens, more suitable pictures will be taken. Yessssssssssss.</p>

<p>Time to start shopping for new wheels and tires (it came with brand new winter ones). Also need an oil and fuel filter change. New floor mats???</p>

<p>Click through to see a few more pictures. I was hoping to alleviate the load time on the main page.</p>
