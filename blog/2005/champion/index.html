      <h1>
        Champion
      </h1>





<p>Got a call last night. My Pops won the Pipestone Country Club golf championship for the third time in four years. He was two over par and amazingly I think he only had one birdie. I believe it is 27 holes. That’s a lot of pars.</p>

<p>It was kind of neat because three of his friends also won their flights. One of his other friends was unfortunately in the Championship flight with my Dad, so he was smacked down by the champion.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ll say it ain’t bad for someone to win the club championship at the ages of 52, 53, and 55. In fact, I believe mostly high school kids are at the top of the leader board each year.</p>

<p>CONGRATULATIONS!</p>
