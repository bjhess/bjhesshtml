        Collateral
      </h1>





<p>Just finished watching the Cruise/Foxx flick, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bjhesscom-20&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2FB00005JN2Z%2Fqid%3D1106368289%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Ddvd"><em>Collateral</em></a>. Pretty good movie, actually, though it falls into cliche at times. I liked the use of music. It felt fairly unique. For instance, I was a bit jarred both when Bach’s “Air” came on and when Audioslave’s “Shadow on the Sun” played. Hey, and a little “The Seed 2.0” by The Roots for good measure. A lot of different tunes.</p>

<p>I also remember early in the movie thinking that the city shots from the air were sublime. Really beautiful. Counterpoints were made later as the helicopters swarmed through the sky, but I think that angle could have been used more extensively. I was hoping for very high sky shots throughout the movie, expecting to see a chase viewed from the sky with a calm soundtrack underneath it.</p>

<p>Again, I say pretty good movie, but I kind of compare this to other summer action movies. Always a shorter yardstick. Looking back, we were treated to some pretty decent action flicks in 2004. We had <em>Kill Bill 2</em>, <em>Sparta</em>, <em>Team America</em>, <em>The Bourne Supremacy</em>, <em>Collateral</em>, <em>Man on Fire</em> (sorta), <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>Hero</em>, <em>National Treasure</em> and <em>Ocean's 12</em>. And I still haven’t seen <em>The House of Flying Daggers</em>.</p>
