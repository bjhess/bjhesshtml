      <h1>
        Comedian for Senator? Don't Laugh
      </h1>





<p>I was watching a CSPAN broadcast of some sort of truth in journalism representative conference with a panel of left-siders in front of the House representatives. I have to admit I found Franken’s sincerity and apparent knowledge of the details surrounding the FOX newsroom winning me over. In general I think Franken versus Coleman would be an interesting race, but I can’t even imagine the amount of muck that would be slung across the battlelines. It may be downright unbearable.</p>

<p>I mainly link to this for the reference to Brave New Workshop.</p>

<p>A couple good paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>It can get mighty personal mighty fast for a native son whom everyone seems to know.

"I jumped ya twice in Thief River Falls," said a middle-age woman in greeting at the pre-speech party in a tent next to the Ted Mann Concert Hall at the University of Minnesota here. The seeming inference of long-ago sexual congress would cause deep blushing elsewhere, but it actually meant that Faith Rud and Mr. Franken had bonded in a far more profoundly Minnesotan way: she had used jumper cables to revive his Volkswagen bus on a cold night long ago after a college gig.</blockquote>
<p>On the contradictions of Minnesota politics:</p>
<blockquote>...Minnesota is a place of enormous, and not easily explained, contradictions. A place where lions of the Democratic party - Hubert H. Humphrey and Eugene J. McCarthy - once strode the earth, it takes voting very seriously, with a 79 percent turnout in the 2004 general election. Yet in 1998 it elected a professional wrestler to run the state. Minnesotans, who show up in droves at the state fair to marvel at seed art and butter sculptures but also show up en masse at the legitimate theater, are their own darn thing. So frequently cast as droll practitioners of the art of common sense, they have displayed some fairly atavistic tendencies, electing Mr. Ventura out of nowhere as both a slap and a jolt to the system. In their own quiet way, they remain mad as hell and are not going to take it anymore.</blockquote>
<p>BNW:</p>
<blockquote>"I'd like to think that somebody like me, who says what he thinks and gets his facts right, has a place in politics," Mr. Franken said much later on Saturday, sitting in the Brave New Workshop comedy club on the south side of Minneapolis, where he started performing while in high school. Mr. Franken grew up in St. Louis Park, a Minneapolis suburb, and was admitted to Blake, a competitive and expensive prep school, because, he said, "they needed some Jews to get their SAT scores up."</blockquote>
