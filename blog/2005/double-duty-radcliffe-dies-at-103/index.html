      <h1>
        'Double Duty' Radcliffe Dies at 103
      </h1>





      <p>Ted “Double Duty” Radcliffe <a
          href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-obit-radcliffe&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">died</a> today. He
        was thought to be the oldest living professional ballplayer, at 103 years old. “Double Duty” came from his
        prowess as both a pitcher and a catcher.</p>
      <blockquote>Radcliffe, given his singular nickname by sports writer Damon Runyon after catching Satchel Paige in
        the first game of a doubleheader in the 1932 Negro League World Series and pitching a shutout in the second
        game, died from complications after a long bout with cancer, the Chicago White Sox said.</blockquote>
      <p>This serves as a reminder to me that I need to visit the <a href="http://www.nlbm.com/">Negro Leagues Baseball
          Museum</a> someday soon. And a new thing to add to my list, <a
          href="http://www.baseballpilgrimages.com/rickwood.html">Rickwood Field</a>, the oldest professional baseball
        stadium and home of the <a href="http://www.rickwood.com/">Rickwood Classic</a>.</p>

      <p>I mean, check out those lights:</p>

      <p>Hmmm…a road trip through Chicago, down to St. Louis, then Birmingham, and maybe back up and across through
        Memphis over to Kansas City. Sounds like a plan.</p>
