      <h1>
        Dragline
      </h1>





      <p>My little band that no one knows about is <a
          href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:tgjm7iajg72r">Paw</a>. Their last album was sort of
        <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wv8e4j274way">released</a> in 2000. It’s more of an
        EP and I don’t think it was a very big process to put it together.</p>

      <p>Back in 1995 I came to Paw in a peculiar way. I was a big Soundgarden fan. Reading a Road Rash (don’t remember
        which iteration) video game review, I saw mention of tracks from Soundgarden and other like bands in the game.
        One of those bands was Paw. I bought their <a
          href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:hl6omped9f7o">debut disc</a> shortly thereafter and
        the rest is history.</p>

      <p>Anyway, I miss them. I wish they’d get back together. Their two full albums were outstanding. Etc, etc, etc.
      </p>

      <p>One of my favorite songs by Paw is “<a href="http://members.cox.net/defgav/paw/lyrics.html#dl8">Dragline</a>.”
        The thing that caught me with Paw, that I only could bring myself to explain later in life, was their mixture of
        heavy rock and country. I don’t listen to country music. (Okay, I suppose I’d listen to country Ray Charles,
        Cash, and Willie if pressed.) Yet something spoke to me in the music, lyrics, and general presentation.
        Certainly it was all part of my rural upbringing.</p>

      <p>Songs like “Dragline” grabbed my ear and wouldn’t let go. The father and son connections. Lyrics like “A beat
        up piece of Chevrolet.” Excellent. What heavy song of any era makes reference to “Buster Browns?” The
        transcendent familial moments expressed in one or two lines throughout the song are amazing.</p>

        I push to fight<br />
        He says, "Let's go"<br />
        I said, "All right"<br />
        Hey, I said, "Okay"<br />
        <br />
        Yeah, Poppa bought a pick-up truck<br />
        With bottle tops and that's enough<br />
        A beat up piece of Chevrolet<br />

        Aww, still we ride<br />
        Yeah, just father and son<br />

        Small child, front seat<br />
        Mouth in dad's ear<br />
        As they drive that truck<br />

        I ask to drive<br />
        And he says, "Okay"<br />

        Well, Papa bought a pick up truck<br />
        With bottle tops and that's enough<br />
        A beat up piece of Chevrolet<br />
        Blue and white rustin' away<br />
        Aw, still we ride<br />
        Yeah, just father and son<br />

        <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0061512/">Cool Hand</a> says, "I'm a man who can eat fifty eggs"<br />
        And, "Sayin' it's your job, don't make it, make it right"<br />
        We laugh, we cry<br />
        We say, "That's right"<br />
        He says, "Let's drive"<br />
        We say, "All right"<br />
        Yeah, we said, "Okay"<br />
        <br />
        Papa says, "Let's go for a ride"<br />
        "Oh, We'll grab a bite to eat"<br />
        "Hell boy, might even let you drive"<br />
        I said, "Hey pop, oh, turn up the radio"<br />
        "Aw, 'cause that's my favorite song"<br />
        "Hey, that's my favorite song"<br />
        As we went along<br />
        Oh, roll down your window<br />
        As we went along<br />
        Yeah, just father and son<br />
        Hey, just like we were<br />
        Yeah, a father and son<br />
        Hey Papa, "Dairy Queen sounds good to me"<br />
        And Papa, "Pull off here, I've got to take a leak"<br />
        And Papa, "You're gonna have to kill me, to keep me down"<br />
        And Papa, you laugh when I say,<br />
        "Move it up here, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragline">Dragline</a>"<br />
        Oh, Dragline<br />
        Uh, uh, uh</blockquote>
      <p>And yet I still have never watched <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0061512/">Cool Hand Luke</a></em>. I’m
        a jerk.</p>

      <p><em>(Note: I realize the pickup truck link is for a Ford, but that's basically what I envision when hearing the
          lyric. That with rust.)</em></p>
