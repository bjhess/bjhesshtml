      <h1>
        Freedom of (All) Speech
      </h1>





      <p>As our government grows more and more delirious with power by the day, we could all stand to read through this.
        My favorite:</p>
      <blockquote><b>James H. Warner, letter to Washington Post, 11 July 1989</b><br />
        <br />
        As I stepped out of the aircraft [after being released from captivity in Vietnam], I looked up and saw the flag.
        I caught my breath, then, as tears filled my eyes, I saluted it. I never loved my country more than at that
        moment. . . . I cannot compromise on freedom. It hurts to see the flag burned, but I part company with those who
        want to punish the flag burners. . . .<br />
        <br />
        I remember one interrogation [by the North Vietnamese] where I was shown a photograph of some Americans
        protesting the war by burning a flag. "There," the officer said. "People in your country protest against your
        cause. That proves that you are wrong."<br />
        <br />
        "No," I said. "That proves I am right. In my country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that people
        disagree with us." The officer was on his feet in an instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist on
        the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear,
        in his eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten the satisfaction I felt at using his tool,
        the picture of the burning flag against him. . . .<br />
        <br />
        We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because
        they hate America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to hurt them than with the subversive idea of
        freedom? Spread freedom. . . . Don't be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon we have.</blockquote>
      <p>And another nugget from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes%2C_Jr.">Justice Oliver
          Wendell Holmes, Jr.</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even
        more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better
        reached by free trade in ideas - that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted
        in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be
        carried out.</blockquote>
      <p>I can’t stop. This makes my heart swell. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_D._Brandeis">Justice Louis
          D. Brandeis</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Those who won our independence believed that the final end of the State was to make men free to
        develop their faculties; and that in its government the deliberative forces should prevail over the arbitrary.
        They valued liberty both as an end and as a means. They believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and
        courage to be the secret of liberty. They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think
        are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly
        discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the
        dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public
        discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government. They
        recognized the risks to which all human institutions are subject. But they knew that order cannot be secured
        merely through fear of punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and
        imagination; that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable government; that
        the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies; and that
        the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the power of reason as applied through public
        discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by law - the argument of force in its worst form. Recognizing the
        occasional tyrannies of governing majorities, they amended the Constitution so that free speech and assembly
        should be guaranteed.</blockquote>
      <p>Really, what more can I say that these guys haven’t said 100 times more eloquently.</p>
