      <h1>
        iPod Video
      </h1>





<p>I’m not going to be able to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aM6PvSxM.wq8&amp;refer=us">hold out</a> much longer. The one thing that will protect me from buying an iPod is the Video’s screen size. If I’m going to watch video, I need something like <a href="http://archos.com/products/av_700/tech_specs.html">this</a>. I mean, look at that screen. Beautiful. (The reviews tend to <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/reviews/n/6101.html">disagree</a>, and the video conversion “issue” below is still a possibility.)</p>

<p>I’ve owned an <a href="http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/2002/archosmultimedia.html">Archos Multimedia</a> for a couple years now. The big sell with the Archos was the ability to offload a CF card onto the 20 GB hard drive. Great for vacations. Unfortunately shortly after buying the player I stopped going on substantial vacations. I used the feature a few times, but now my CF cards are large to the point of not having a need. I liked putting videos on the player for long drives on I-90 (serious). Unfortunately getting a video onto the player typically required a long translation process through software like Virtual Dub. AVI only - and not all AVI. 20 minute conversions meant no conversions. And of course the big thing is the Archos music navigation is vastly inferior to that of the iPod.</p>

<p>Maybe I should just consider an iPod for music and something else for video? Or maybe I should just build a Mac Mini into my Jetta and be <a href="http://forums.vwvortex.com/zerothread?id=2127323&amp;postid=22904163#22904163">done</a> with it?</p>
