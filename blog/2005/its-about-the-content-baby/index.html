        It's About the Content, Baby
      </h1>





<p>I love clever graphics with my sporting events as much as the next guy. But perhaps FOX NFL’s decision to obscure a full seventh of the horizontal screen space to show little snowflakes fly by above the score display was a little rash. Maybe that space could be used for something more worthwhile, like depicting the football game I tuned in to watch? Just a thought. Of course the value add of piling snowbanks and animated snow plows is probably too much to resist.</p>

<p>To add to my list of football announcer annoyances. Tony Siragusa brought out the “And you don’t think that guy’s a competitor” during the Pats-Bucs game. Who was he talking about? Yep, you guessed it. Tom Brady. Apparently some people were thinking the three time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady isn’t a competitor.</p>
