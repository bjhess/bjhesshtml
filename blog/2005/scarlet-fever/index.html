        Scarlet Fever
      </h1>





<p>Found out one of my coworkers is home with a sick kid. A sick kid with Scarlet Fever. I started getting short of breath. I’ve talked to this guy a couple times in the last week. What if this plague hits me? What could that mean?</p>

<p>Turns out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_A_streptococcal_infection#Scarlet_fever.2FScarlatina">Scarlet Fever</a> isn’t anywhere near the worst thing you can contract these days:</p>
<blockquote>Read any novel of the 18th century and Scarlet Fever often seems to be followed by many months in convalescence institutions. Most children now are ill for under a week. Whilst this is used as an example of the benefits of antibiotics, it is also true that the bacteria mutated in the early-mid 20th century into less virulent forms. The term Scarlatina is used to describe the modern milder disease.</blockquote><!--adsense-->
