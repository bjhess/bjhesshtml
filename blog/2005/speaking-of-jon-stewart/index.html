      <h1>
        Speaking of Jon Stewart
      </h1>





      <p>I dug out my old ReplayTV today. I’m planning on lending it to a friend on kind of a rent-to-own basis. What
        this probably means is the longer he borrows it, the less money I’d require for him to keep it permanently.
        Pretty good deal for him. Unfortunately, now that I don’t have land line phone service I can’t make full use of
        it.</p>

      <p>Before passing on the beauty that is DVR, I figured I should check out what programs I still have sitting on
        the thing. Some movies I have yet to see: <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, <em>The Two Jake</em>s, and more. There was
        one thing I knew would be there. One thing I wanted to watch again before moving on. The <a
          href="http://anitasdailyshowpage.tripod.com/transcripts/2001okay.htm">September 20th, 2001, Daily Show
          monologue</a>, aptly titled “Are You OK” at the linked transcript site.</p>

      <p>I didn’t see Letterman’s response to the attacks, or Rather’s or Conan’s. Yet I still went around saying that
        Jon Stewart’s emotional monologue was the best of the bunch. Watching it again solidified my uninformed, though
        confident, stand. In retrospect, he stumbled and staggered a bit, but it rang as loud and clear as ever when I
        watched it again this evening.</p>

      <p>So tonight I’ve scoured with Google and eMule, trying to find a video clip I can store long term. No luck. I
        just finally found a transcript before typing this post. The biggest hurdle to finding a clip is the brouhaha
        over Stewart’s Crossfire appearance. It is drowning out any searches I try.</p>

      <p>So with that I’ll leave you with the transcript I linked to above. This is my form of saving it for myself. Who
        knows how long the site I linked to will be around?</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>September 20, 2001</p>

        <p>With Jon Stewart</p>

        <p></p>Good evening and welcome to the Daily Show. We are back. This is our first show since the tragedy in New
        York
        City and there is really no other way to start the show then to ask you at home the question that we asked the
        audience here tonight and that we’ve asked everybody we know here in New York since September 11, and that is,
        "Are you okay?" And we pray that you are and that your family is.</p>

        <p></p>I'm sorry to do this to you. It's another entertainment show beginning with an overwrought speech of a
        shaken
        host--and television is nothing if not redundant. So I apologize for that. Its something that, unfortunately, we
        do for ourselves so that we can drain whatever abscess is in our hearts and move on to the business of making
        you laugh, which we haven’t been able to do very effectively lately. Everyone has checked in already. I know we
        are late. I’m sure we are getting in just under the wire before the cast of Survivor offers their insight into
        what to do in these situations. They said to get back to work. There were no jobs open for a man in the fetal
        position under his desk crying. . . which I gladly would have taken. So I come back here and tonight’s show is
        not obviously a regular show. We looked through the vault and found some clips that we think will make you
        smile, which is really what’s necessary, I think, right about now.</p>

        <p></p>A lot of folks have asked me, "What are you going to do when you get back? What are you going to say? I
        mean,
        jeez, what a terrible thing to have to do." And you know, I don’t see it as a burden at all. I see it as a
        privilege. I see it as a privilege and everyone here does. The show in general we feel like is a privilege. Even
        the idea that we can sit in the back of the country and make wise cracks. . . which is really what we do. We sit
        in the back and throw spitballs--but never forgetting that it is a luxury in this country that allows us to do
        that. That is, a country that allows for open satire, and I know that sounds basic and it sounds like it goes
        without saying. But that’s really what this whole situation is about. It’s the difference between closed and
        open. The difference between free and. . . burdened. And we don’t take that for granted here, by any stretch of
        the imagination. And our show has changed. I don’t doubt that. And what it has become I don’t know.
        "Subliminible" is not a punchline anymore. Someday it will become that again, Lord willing it will become that
        again, because it means that we have ridden out the storm.</p>

        <p>The main reason that I wanted to speak tonight is not to tell you what the show is going to be, not to tell
          you
          about all the incredibly brave people that are here in New York and in Washington and around the country, but
          we’ve had an unenduring pain, an unendurable pain and I just. . . I just wanted to tell you why I grieve--but
          why I don’t despair. (choking back tears) I’m sorry. . . (chuckles slightly) luckily we can edit this. . .
          (beats lightly on his desk, collects himself).</p>

        <p>One of my first memories was of Martin Luther King being shot. I was five and if you wonder if this feeling
          will
          pass. . . (choked up). . . When I was five and he was shot, this is what I remember about it. I was in school
          in
          Trenton and they turned the lights off and we got to sit under our desks. . . and that was really cool. And
          they
          gave us cottage cheese, which was a cold lunch because there were riots, but we didn’t know that. We just
          thought, "My God! We get to sit under our desks and eat cottage cheese!" And that’s what I remember about it.
          And that was a tremendous test of this country's fabric and this country has had many tests before that and
          after that.</p>

        <p>The reason I don’t despair is that. . . this attack happened. It's not a dream. But the aftermath of it, the
          recovery, is a dream realized. And that is Martin Luther King's dream.</p>

        <p>Whatever barriers we put up are gone. Even if it's just momentary. We are judging people by not the color of
          their skin, but the content of their character. (pause) You know, all this talk about "These guys are criminal
          masterminds. They got together and their extraordinary guile and their wit and their skill. . ." It's all a
          lie.
          Any fool can blow something up. Any fool can destroy. But to see these guys, these firefighters and these
          policemen and people from all over the country, literally with buckets, rebuilding. . . that’s extraordinary.
          And that's why we have already won. . . they can't. . . it's light. It's democracy. They can't shut that down.
        </p>

        <p>They live in chaos. And chaos, it can't sustain itself--it never could. It's too easy and it's too
          unsatisfying.
          The view. . . from my apartment. . . (choking up) was the World Trade Center. . .</p>

        <p>Now it's gone. They attacked it. This symbol of. . . of American ingenuity and strength. . . and labor and
          imagination and commerce and it's gone. But you know what the view is now? The Statue of Liberty. . . the view
          from the south of Manhattan is the Statue of Liberty. . .</p>

        <p>You can’t beat that. . .</p>
