<p>Maybe I’ve never looked closely enough, but I just realized the ribbon magnets on the back of cars (well, mostly SUV’s and mini-vans) say “Support our troops” rather than “We support our troops.”</p>

<p>I dislike them even more now. I used to think they were terribly presumptuous. “We support our troops” implied that anyone without a magnet on their vehicle at the least didn’t support the troops and at the most were against the troops.</p>

<p>“Support our troops” is a pretty demanding declarative. Heck, it seems to smack people in the face even if they have their own sticker. “(You) support our troops. Or else!”</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p>It may be fun to develop a “Support terrorists” magnetic ribbon to slap on any sub-20-miles-per-gallon four passenger vehicle. Who’s game?</p>
