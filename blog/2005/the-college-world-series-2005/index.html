      <h1>
        The College World Series 2005
      </h1>

      <em>Unfortunately the pictures are forever broken on this post.</em>

      <p>This past week my friend James and I made our 2nd Annual Trek to The College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska.
        Last year we attended at the last minute, booking a hotel where we could get it (Lincoln) and taking off without
        an idea what we would be doing. This year we planned on planning better, if that makes any sense, but
        unfortunately our weekends didn’t work out and it was almost a no go. We decided it was worth the vacation and
        took off for Tuesday and Wednesday games, which have the distinct advantage of being more sparsely attended.</p>

      <p>Good old Rosenblatt Stadium awaited us. Conveniently located right next to I-80, we found that the new Jetta
        provided a distinct advantage when it came to finding a parking spot. Both days we slid in about 2-3 blocks from
        the stadium - free of charge.</p>

      <p>Game 1 of Session 7 found us in the left field general admission for the Nebraska/Arizona State tilt. Having
        Nebraska in the World Series made things interesting. Typically a team would have a small contingent of fans
        that would get riled up in certain game situations. But for this game, Rosenblatt became home field to the
        Cornhuskers (who actually happened to be the “away” team). It actually made the game fun in that it was
        different. Typically attended by College World Series fans, the CWS momentarily became outdoor baseball with as
        raucous a crowd as a college baseball game will ever see. Very few college baseball games are attended by 20,000
        home team fans.</p>

      <p>The game was a classic in every sense right down to the Grady Little/Ron Gardenhire coaching meltdown. After
        both teams made their requisite late inning comebacks, Nebraska found themselves on top. Giving up a run in the
        ninth found the ‘Huskers up by 1. Next batter for ASU was a young man who had already hit two home runs. James
        and I assumed an intentional walk. Next pitch…he’s not walking him…down the middle…BLAST to dead center field.
        ASU wins in extra.</p>

      <p>Game 2 of Session 7 saw Baylor meet Tulane, the top ranked team in the country. Tulane had already lost in the
        tourney - we were watching elimination Tuesday. Tulane jumps on top by 6 and never looks back. Unfortunate for
        them because if they had looked back they’d have seen a Baylor team creeping into the game in the seventh
        inning.</p>

      <p>This game featured some of the worst first base play I’ve seen since the Matthew LeCroy fielding clinic. It was
        astounding. I don’t know if we saw a single dig or scoop in the game by either team. To be honest, digging is
        not that hard unless there is a kooky bounce (say off the edge of the grass) or if you are out of position on
        the bag.</p>

      <p>So Baylor hits into a game ending double play with the bases loaded, down by 1 run. The second baseman takes a
        tough short hop, steps on second, and fires a wide throw to first. We were sitting right behind first for this
        game and in my opinion the first baseman should have fielded it for the out. Granted it was a tough play, but at
        the very least he should have come off the bag to block the ball. He didn’t. The ball got by first and
        <strong>two</strong> runs scored on the “inning ending double play.” Again, a game just short of a classic
        because it was a blow out for six innings.</p>

      <p>Game 1 of Session 7 saw ASU play the undefeated (in the CWS) Florida Gators. Finally we attended a game that
        was never really close. At least the first base play was much improved. Pretty much all the pictures below are
        from this game because my camera was out of memory on Tuesday (poor planning).</p>

      <p>Game 2 of Session 8 was heard on our drive back to Owatonna. We only heard the end, but it sounded like a
        doozy, complete with a catcher’s interference call and a walk-off home run by a player whose shoulder was
        separating every time he swang. Earlier in the game he crumpled in the batter’s box on a groundout.</p>

      <p>The whole two days saw heat indexes at a minimum of 105. Ungodly hot making me pine for the ‘Dome. We also
        learned that, especially on the weekdays, it is nearly pointless to arrive with tickets unless you somehow are
        able to secure solid reserved seats in advance. There is a healthy scalping market, and weekdays are better
        since a ticket gives entrance to both games and many leave the first game allowing for the double-sold tickets
        to be a great value from street sellers (or the ticket-holders themselves).</p>

      <p>On to the pictures.</p>
