        The Irony of "Support Our Troops"
      </h1>





<p>I would like to ask those I know who appear to blindly support the current administration how the heck they are able to ignore the “black and white” moral questions that are ongoing and sanctioned <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/20/AR2005062001107.html">torture</a> and insufficient troop numbers in Iraq? Why does “support our troops” somehow equate to “support our administration that isn’t supporting our troops?” How can someone who has a child fighting for Iraqi freedom get incensed by John Kerry’s Vietnam war record but not give a rip about an administration fueling an insurgency (via torture) while not offering its native sons protection (via improved equipment and more able bodies)?</p>

<p>If I had a child or close relative over there I would be incensed with the actions of George Bush, Dick Cheney, Rummy, Gonzalez and the rest. I’ve never fought anyone, but I can imagine coming to blows with an opinionated military family member who would dare to disagree with me.</p>

<p>And this reaction is not even considering the basic moral questions of the torture; only its affect vis-à-vis the safety of our troops. Indeed there are moral questions to be answered with regard to invading a country we have <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_06/006559.php">not planned</a> to secure for the innocent civilians we are trying to deliver from oppression. Oh yeah, and there is another practical question of missed intelligence gathering opportunities the torture has caused.</p>

<p>I realize that it is kind of late to lash out at Bush. We have to wage war with the president we have, not the president we wish we had.</p>

<p>Yet if I were just a little more directly tied to this ongoing war, my first goal as a citizen would be to elect a president in 2008 that had no desire to retain a single employee from the Bush cabinet. While I could care less if that candidate were a Republican or Democrat, there is probably only an infinitesimal chance a nominated right-winger would not toe the party line. A party line that apparently involves <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4122814.stm">co-opting the World Trade Center dead</a> to get a flag burning amendment passed and perpetuating the idea that Christians are one of the most <a href="http://www.nationalledger.com/commentary/article_1565.shtml">put upon</a> groups in America.</p>
