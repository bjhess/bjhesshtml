      <h1>
        TV Now
      </h1>





<p>For the past year I have been sitting on a web site development idea. It was to bring fans together with their favorite stars. A searchable database with star schedules provided by a central network schedule database and/or public updates by the “Internet community.” I could search for my favorite comedian, David Cross, and find out if he is going to guest on a talk show or, since he isn’t a high level star, maybe guest star on a sitcom or some other such show.</p>

<p>Eventually I would plan on developing e-mail notifications where a user could sign-up for notification of the next appearance by so-and-so. Perhaps even further down the line notifications of public (non-television) appearances could appear based on geography.</p>

<p>In the last week or so I had finally started looking at the project, trying to find appropriate technologies to implement as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Well, there seems to already be a <a href="http://www.tv-now.com/stars">site</a> doing the basics of this stuff. While far from a complete compendium (<a href="http://www.tv-now.com/stars/davcross.html">David Cross</a> <strong>is</strong> there) it appears that my idea is probably not worth implementing. Feel free to convince me otherwise.</p>
