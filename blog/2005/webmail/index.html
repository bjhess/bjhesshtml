        Webmail
      </h1>





<p>I am moving on from Yahoo! as my webmail client. Gmail has matured to the point that I can comfortably route all web mail through them. My Gmail account allows me to send mail using my standard e-mail address - you wouldnâ€™t even know I was sending it from Gmail. My standard account is setup to auto forward all incoming messages to Gmail, so I can read them either online or in my mail application. In addition, I setup my mail application (Thunderbird) to BCC all sent mail to Gmail. Gmail auto archives the messages from my standard e-mail address with an appropriate label for easy filtering.</p>

<p>So not only is Gmail my access point on the web for all of my e-mail, but it has also become a complete backup (going forward) of each and every e-mail I send. Fully searchable, and quickly searchable. After all, it is Google.</p>
