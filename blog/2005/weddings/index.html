      <h1>
        Weddings
      </h1>





<p>Two of the past three weekends I was attending weddings. One in which I was the best man, and this past weekend when The Wife was matron of honor. So that’s where I’ve been. I’m still tired.</p>

<p>It was really a fun wedding weekend, though I’m not as young as I used to be. Excellent food, in part because the bride’s father is the <a href="http://www.nppc.org/about/bios/buhl.html">president</a> of the National Pork Producers Council. I am not one to turn down good pork loin, and we had some of the best.</p>

<p>Another great feature of this wedding was the vast participation in the dance. Actually, I don’t think I’ve been to a wedding with this much participation since my own wedding - and this wedding probably had a little more activity. (Well, there was maybe one wedding off-hand that was pretty close.) I don’t dance, but if everyone is out there I’ll be coaxed into a little bit of rug-cutting.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have to go to bed. So here’s a “family picture” to finish:</p>
