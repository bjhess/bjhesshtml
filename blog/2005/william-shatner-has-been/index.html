        William Shatner - Has Been
      </h1>





<p>Well…</p>

<p>I finally took a listen to the William Shatner album that Ben Folds collaborated on. To be honest, I’ve just listened to about half. I surprisingly enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I don’t think this is a favorite for most who have listened, but I did like the Shatner, Ben Folds, and Joe Jackson cover of Pulp’s “Common People.”</p>

<p>The other tracks I listened to consisted of Shatner’s rather interesting voice speaking poems over music. This is a genre I haven’t exactly heard extensively, indeed I don’t think it exists extensively. His reading in “That’s Me Trying” is downright heart rending. Of course, there’s humor in the album. For instance the collaboration with Henry Rollins, “I Can’t Get Behind That.”</p>

<p>I can’t really recommend a purchase, but by all means if you get a chance, listen to the album through.</p>
