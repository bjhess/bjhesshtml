      <h1>
        Florida Trip
      </h1>





      <p>The Family and I dropped down to Fort Myers, Florida, for a week to watch some Twins baseball and do some
        general sight-seeing and beaching. I’ll save the Spring Training discussion for another post, but needless to
        say it was a good time. 80-degree weather with no rain was also a good time, thank you very much.</p>

      <p>This was The Kid’s first flight. For the most part she was happy to be there and liked being on the plane,
        especially since she just recently started spotting planes and hearing planes as they pass overhead. She was
        mostly good on the way there (not as much on the way back). Either way it didn’t really matter since about 75%
        of both flights were families with kids. A good flight to take with a little one.</p>

      <p>Stepping into the Southwest Florida International Airport’s baggage claim area, I mentioned to The Wife that it
        smelled like a hospital. And thus began our numerous close encouters with the retired kind. Fort Myers is not a
        Spring Break destination by any means. Sure, there are pockets of college kids going wild, but by-in-large we
        were in 60-year-old country.</p>

      <p>I planned this trip rather late, as I tend to do with any trip I plan, so hotel choice was limited. In the end
        we got a pretty good location for a reasonable price compared to the prices I saw in my searches. We ended up at
        the <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/hi/1/en/hd/fmybe">Holiday Inn</a>, <a
          href="http://local.google.com/local?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=ft.+myers+beach&amp;ll=26.422158,-81.917152&amp;spn=0.114528,0.159645">Fort
          Myers Beach</a>. It was a rather small hotel for a hotel on the beach. I’d say this is a good thing as no room
        was far from any amenity. We were steps from the pool and the beach was right outside the hotel. Though it was a
        decent walk to get to the water it didn’t seem that our hotel was much further from the water than others. Since
        the hotel had a refrigerator, we were able to go cheap for all our breakfasts and lunches. Mainly, this helped
        us keep from overeating, which is a problem we tend to have.</p>

      <!--more-->
      <p>We stopped in to the local <a href="http://publix.com/">Publix</a> to pick up some provisions for the hotel
        room and noticed two obvious signs that we were in snow-bird heaven. There were approximately 20 handicapped
        parking spots outside of the store. After checking out I also noticed a change machine. Meaning a machine where
        one could bring one’s 10-gallon pickle jar filled with pennies, pour said pennies into the machine, and receive
        greenbacks in return. Somewhat convenient, but not worth a grocer’s time in most other regions of the country.
      </p>

      <p>One key pick-up at the Publix was some <a href="http://yuengling.com/">Yuengling Traditional Lager</a>, which
        I’ve often been told try. The beer made it’s way down the coast from Pottsville with all the other winter
        travellers. I’m thankful.</p>

      <p>As we sat drinking outside our room that night, we watched the older folks leave the Tiki Bar to stagger back
        home. Those that are concerned about hearing their grandparents swear maybe should watch themselves in Fort
        Myers. This is their environment and they’ll do what they want to. One couple walked by and told us, “Don’t tell
        our grandkids we’re out so late.” It was 9:30.</p>

      <p>We visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanibel_Island">Sanibel and Captiva Island</a> and <a
          href="http://www.fws.gov/dingdarling/">J. N. "Ding" Darling National Wildlife Refuge</a>. The refuge was OK,
        but The Kid wasn’t interested. I think some of the canoeing would be a blast, but that wasn’t in the cards for
        our family unit. We sat on a beach there and, as with all the beaches we visited, there were a ridiculous amount
        of shells around. The Wife was nearly convulsing with all the shelling she was able to do. Not only were the
        shells all over up and down the beach, but also into the water. When I stepped into the water I could feel all
        of the shells crunching under my feet. About 3-4 feet into the water I would hit a shell “hill,” which would
        drop off severly into normal, fine-grain sand after another couple feet.</p>

      <p>Next day we visited the <a href="http://nps.gov/ever/">Everglades National Park</a>‘s <a
          href="http://www.nps.gov/ever/visit/activ-gc.htm">Gulf Coast Visitor's Center</a>. The biggest attraction in
        this area of the park is the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/southeast/TenThousandIsland/">Ten Thousand Islands
          National Wildlife Refuge</a>. Basically, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove">Mangrove tree</a>
        seedlings float in the water for up to a year until they can grab on to a sand bar. Once they grab, over time,
        an island will form around their roots (very <a
          href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f0/Mangroves.jpg">unique</a> roots) which collect debris and
        other Mangrove seedlings. The landscape is neat, but grows fairly redundant. The trees weren’t nearly as green
        as they usually are due to last year’s hurricane season. I’d imagine the visual impact would be a little more
        interesting if the trees were more alive. In any case, the Mangrove ecosystem is pretty unique and interesting.

      <p>The best part of our short boat tour was happening upon some dolphins near the Gulf of Mexico. The guide asked
        us all to move to the back of the boat to increase our wake size. We then rode with the dolphins for about
        fifteen minutes. The whole time they swam with us in our wake, jumping out of the water frequently. It was
        pretty cool. The Kid was bragging about “see dolphins” for the next couple hours.</p>

      <p><a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1224/585380118_52a466dbc1_b.jpg" rel="lightbox"
          title="Touring the Everglades, on the Gulf of Mexico side, we had the joy of trailing dolphins jumping this way and that."><img

            src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1224/585380118_52a466dbc1.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

      <p>Before we docked, the guide gave us insight on where to go to see alligators. We hadn’t seen any yet and we
        weren’t too comfortable taking an airboat ride with The Kid. The guide mentioned that there are over 2 million
        alligators in Florida and there is an alligator hunting season to keep the population controlled enough to
        minimize alligator grazing in back yards. I didn’t realize there were so many alligators down there. Population
        control will only become a bigger issue as the area continues to grow exponentially with the upcoming boomer
        retirements.</p>

      <p>Anyway, this alligator lazing area was right off a major highway. Fences were up to protect us citizens (though
        there was a gap about 50 ft down the fenceline that would certainly allow an alligator to come through). Anyway,
        we <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1058/584973635_9bdf91bb56_b.jpg" rel="lightbox"
          title="Alligators like to lay around">saw</a> as <a

      <p><a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1310/584935505_e22e90fb5f_b.jpg" rel="lightbox"
          title="The Kid was young enough not to be too frightened of the predators on the other side of the fence."><img

            width="500"></a></p>

      <p>Next we went to the <a href="http://www.caribbeangardens.com/">Naples Zoo</a>. It was a relatively small zoo
        and not an outstanding place. They had a lot of construction. Their unique feature was these monkey islands
        where they had monkey-types freely living without fencing of any sort. They boat you around and give a little
        guided tour. It is nice to see the monkeys in a more natural environment. Apparently the monkeys assume there is
        danger in the water and they simply will not cross it under any circumstances. I did run into an interesting
        display by the <a href="http://www.nwf.org">National Wildlife Federation</a>. I’m going to peruse their site a
        bit, but from what I understand they can help you plant stuff in your backyard that attracts regional wildlife
        and minimizes upkeep because the plantlife is native to the area you live.</p>

      <p>A cool place we visited before flying out was <a
          href="http://www.captiva.com/stateparks/sixmilecypress.htm">Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve</a>, a
        boardwalked park in the greenest of green marshland. We saw lots of <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_moccasin">water moccasins</a>, various largish birds and a bunch of
        turtles and fish. The otters were unfortunately not out and about. We really had to rush through here and I wish
        we could have took our time. It’s certainly an oasis in the middle of that city.</p>

      <p><a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1178/585309292_db1d8249d8_b.jpg" rel="lightbox"
          title="Really I wouldn't like to be any closer."><img alt="Water Moccasin" height="375"

      <p><a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1126/584901907_8496959134_b.jpg" rel="lightbox"
          title="Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve was quite beautiful in its greenness."><img alt="Green, Green, Green"

      <p>A large part of our time was spent sitting on the beach or in the pool. It was over 80 degrees every day, after
        all. We verified that the sun can still burn skin and The Kid has my complexion (meaning our sub-two-year-old
        now has a tan despite the gobs of sunblock used on her skin). I’d like to think she enjoyed seeing some things
        she has never seen before. At least she’s still talking about “dolphins” and “gators.”</p>
