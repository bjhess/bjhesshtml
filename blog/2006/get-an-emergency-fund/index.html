        Get an Emergency Fund

<p>I think it’s always good to remind people to <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/08/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund/"><em>start an emergency fund</em></a>. Today I do this service for you in the form of a link. Semi-full disclosure: I have what I consider to be about a 5-month emergency fund, with 6 months coming soon. (You can read about my emergency fund travails <a href="../../bjhessblog/index.html%3Fp=649.html">here</a>.) I am probably on the high side in terms of the $$$‘s in my emergency fund. It might be a better idea to cut it in half and invest the remainder.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I like the security the emergency fund provides. If I am no longer gainfully employed, we will have a place to draw that mortgage payment with minimal impact on our long-term financial goals. If I wish to take some unpaid time off for family reasons, the emergency fund would be a place to go. Is 6 months a bit high? Sure, but if I had to dip into an IRA or max out a credit card in the case of an emergency, I’ll wish I had that emergency fund.</p>

<p>I’m currently struggling with paying off debt. Financially it seems to make more sense to pay off in advance only those loans that are, say, 6% and above. Simplistically speaking, if I think I can get 7+% back from the market while only saving 6% from a loan principal payment, I should invest in the market. However, eliminating loans seems like a good idea (though I doubt I’ll ever pre-pay on my mortgage). If our only monthly debt cost was our mortgage, we could reduce our emergency fund, invest that money, and simply live a little more stress-free. We would be more agile to take some risks that could have negative financial impacts since we are living under a significantly smaller umbrella of debt. That is unless we in turn feel stress because we are not growing our umbrella of investment - investing being the big loser in a scenario where cash flow is severely reduced.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on eliminating debt?</p>

<p>Another worthwhile tip in the link above is to have some cash stashed in your home. Seems like a good plan to keep your family eating for a couple weeks until the emergency fund truly needs to be hammered.</p>
