      <h1>
        Hooray for Florida
      </h1>





<p>We’re off to Florida tomorrow morning. First flight with The Kid, so it should be more than interesting. I’m not particularly excited for it, but she’ll probably do OK.</p>

<p>We have tickets to Twins’ games on Saturday and Tuesday. I think both are televised, so look for us. I want to say we’ll be behind the plate on Tuesday, but I really can’t remember which game has us sitting there. Practices before the games should be fun - wonder if I’ll have the guts to talk to any of the coaches? Apparently they are very accessible throughout practice.</p>

<p>Other than that, we’ll make a trek to Sanibel Island, the Naples Zoo and the Everglades. My top goal on all of these excursions is to protect The Kid from being eaten. I’d imagine a sub-2-year-old would be mighty tantalizing to a ‘gator. I wonder if it would be best to run or to throw other toddlers at the ‘gator until it is sated?</p>

<p>You’ll be proud of me. I decided not to take my laptop on the trip. We have an overabundance of luggage the way it is and I just didn’t want to carry anything that required delicacy. I would have liked to post pictures and news from America’s wang, but, well, I’d also like to sit by the pool in 80-degree weather. What can I say?</p>

<p>So enjoy your stay up here in the North. Maybe I’ll see you next Friday.</p>
