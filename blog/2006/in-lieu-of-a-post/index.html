<p>I don’t have much to say. The Twins have been sucking. Spring has already brought on a busy schedule. We are in the process of trying to pick out a deck/patio plan, swing set, bikes, and some other things. I’m dutifully ripping CD’s and DVD’s to my network server, but running into issues, natch. I need to revisit my plans for building a server shelf to house my computers in our basement and then I’ll need to buy the wood, tools, and hardware to actually build it. I’ve completely put off reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262011530/sr=8-1/qid=1145979974/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-8737115-1854455?%5Fencoding=UTF8">SICP</a>, which is something I should start by the end of May,</p>

<p>Softball season is beginning soon. I’m not as typically excited for it. I’d like to do some biking and also start a habit of getting 8 hours of sleep each night. Good luck with that, right?</p>

<p>So generally, I feel bad for myself on occasion. I’m just so busy, right? This past weekend my friends held a memorial for the death of their daughter, who died in utero. It was a beautiful service and we were touched to be part of it. I hope the service reinforced for them how many people love them and were eager to meet Ana Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Events like this certainly put me in my place. Losing a child is abhorrent to me, and the idea crashed into my eyes and face as I contorted both trying to deny the very possibility. After the service I could no longer suppress the tears and I succumbed to the emotion of the day for a few minutes. I had a good cry and carried with me the rest of the day the exhaustion one feels with such an emotional release. That touch of weariness allowed me to take a quick peek through the keyhole of my friends’ personal loss to see how draining it must be for them internally. And yet I have no clue.</p>
