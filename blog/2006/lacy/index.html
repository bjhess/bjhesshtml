<p>This is an old-school picture of The Little Sister (pre-braces!) and<br>
our former dog, Lacy.  Lacy was a dalmation that arrived at the home<br>
of The Parents around the same time as The Little Sister.  She grew up<br>
with Lacy.<br>
<br>
At the point this picture was taken, or perhaps a little later, Lacy's<br>
skull collapsed on one side.  She basically had a dent in one side of<br>
her skull that almost looked like an inverse half of a baseball.  I'm<br>
guessing the cause was tumor-related.  She deteriorated from there and<br>
eventually her misery was too great.<br>
<br>
But I thought this was a cute picture from way back when.  Ah, the memories.</p>
