      <h1>
        Mac & Me - Dual Monitors
      </h1>





<p>I am on the verge of making a choice I never really thought I’d make. I have nearly decided that my next computer will be a Mac. An <a href="http://www.apple.com/hardware/">Apple Macintosh</a>!</p>

<p>In case you are wondering how I’m arriving at this eventuality, let me give you one bit of interesting information. I do not even own an iPod. Even though I’m considering buying one within the next few months, I think it’s safe to say I am not a fan-boy. Well, unless you think rather intensly about the fact that I have an old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> computer sitting in a box in my basement.</p>

<p>The driver of this whole decision is frustration. I do a lot of computer tweaking at home. I’ve built a NAS (I really need to post something about this). I watch and listen <a href="../../bjhessblog/index.html%3Fp=739.html">through an Xbox</a>. I have a machine dedicated to ripping discs, downloading content, and serving content on the web. Through all of this I have wrestled countless, unintuitive hours with my Windows machines trying to get hardware and software to work just as I need it to. There has to be a better way!</p>

<p>The more I read, the more I think the better way might just be the Apple way. Perhaps more importantly, I’m reading of an <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/macÂ­.html">underground surge</a> in the adoption of the OSX platform among hackers. Mac users are always the most pompous in the room, and most are just part of a cult. But underneath there lies some truth to the ravings. And some, the hackers, are <a href="http://www.loudthinking.comÂ­/arc/cat_applemacos_x.html">worth listening to</a>, even if it requires a bit of a reality filter.</p>

<p>My first big hurdle to conversion is finding the right hardware configuration for me. My needs lie somewhere between the Mac mini and the Mac Pro. I don’t like the aesthetics of the iMac one bit. First on the hardware requirements list: dual monitors.</p>

<p>I’m running dual monitors on my Windows box. I like dual monitors. They are fun. And I already own them (an 18“ and 19” LCD). I would like to make use of this investment when I buy a new machine. Here are the options I’ve found under the Mac umbrella:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/"><strong>Mac mini</strong></a> - While dual monitors with the mini <a href="http://voice.firefallpro.com/2006/02/mac-mini-dual-monitors-using.html">are possible</a>, there are <a href="http://voice.firefallpro.com/2006/02/mini-w-dual-monitors-part-deux.html">significant enough problems</a> that I don't think I'd like the solution.  Buying a mini would nesessitate the purchase of a new single monitor solution (likely 25"+) and the sale of my current monitors.  I'm not entirely sure the mini supports the resolution required by a monitor of that size.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/"><strong>iMac</strong></a> - Well, I'm not a big fan of the look of the iMac.  Not at all.  Theoretically, a second monitor can be placed next to this beast, but, man, would it be ugly.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macpro/"><strong>Mac Pro</strong></a> - I would probably be willing to run off to another country with this system.  Yeah, it can run as many monitors as I'd ever need.  But it costs some money.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/"><strong>MacBook</strong></a> - The MacBook could run a second monitor, but I'd be stuck with a 13" widescreen display using the laptop LCD as one of the monitors.  Oh, and I think the MacBooks have the super glossy reflective displays, which I don't really like.  The MacBook Pro starts providing some usable monitor real estate, but at that price I'd probably just prefer to get the Mac Pro.</li>
</ul>
<p>With regard to my dual monitor requirements, I’m really not sure which option is best. I’d like to get a look at the plain old MacBooks and see if the small screen would bother me during everyday use. If a plain MacBook won’t cut it for this or other reasons, well, it might be time to research a monitor upgrade for the mini. I really don’t need the Mac Pro. Seriously.</p>
