      <h1>
        Notes on a Book - Purple Cow
      </h1>





<p>I generally had a much better experience reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Purple-Cow-Transform-Business-Remarkable/dp/159184021X/sr=8-1/qid=1166454901/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-5468011-2838569?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><em>Purple Cow</em></a> than reading my previous Seth Godin book, <a href="../../bjhessblog/index.html%3Fp=996.html"><em>The Big Red Fez</em></a>. That’s all I have in the way of a review. Once again, Godin uses a pretty abstract concept, the titular purple cow, throughout the book. I never really felt comfortable with the purple cow as, well, marketing speak for the idea of “remarkable.” Enough said on that front.</p>

<p>Generally I think this book would be most powerful for someone who finds himself having already launched a successful product or service. From there, what does one do to continue innovating while milking the currently successful product? <em>Purple Cow</em> seeks to slap Mr. Success in the face and wake him up.</p>

<p>One last thing: I picked this book up at the library. I think Minnesota’s library system is wonderful for someone in my situation. While I need to purchase reference books, marketing books like <em>Purple Cow</em> are good read-once, note-once, and return books. This particular book came from the Austin public library. I have also received books from the University of Minnesota and The College of St. Scholastica in Duluth. What a deal!</p>

<p><strong>On with the brain dump:</strong></p>

<p>TV industrial complex - find a large, undominated niche. Build a factory. Buy TV ads. Ads lead to sales. Sales create profits. Profits buy more ads. A virtuous cycle. This doesn’t work anymore.</p>

<p>Key to post-TV age - Remarkable rather than average products. Advertise to early adopters rather than to everyone.</p>

<p>Paradoxically targeting a niche is the best way to get to the mainstream. Overwhelming a small part of the market generates a strong response. This niche’s early adopters are more than willing to spread the idea.</p>

<p>Ads should cater to customers you’d choose if you could choose customers.</p>

<p>Go for the edges. Find the edges then test which edge will deliver financial results.</p>

<p>Slogans should be true and worth passing on.</p>

<p>Make it easy for early adopters to sell your idea.</p>

<p>Get permission to tell those you impressed the first time when you have something new and remarkable to share.</p>

<p>Design should build the product’s marketing into itself.</p>

<p>Remarkable often comes from passionate people making something for themselves.</p>

<p>In your business, or in your career, being safe is risky.</p>

<p>It’s not about being weird. It’s about being irresistible to a small group of rabid early adopters.</p>
