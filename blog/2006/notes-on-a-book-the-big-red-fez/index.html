      <h1>
        Notes on a Book - the Big Red Fez
      </h1>





<p>I’ve been doing a lot of reading over the past few months. Technical reading for the most part. I’ve realized that a large chunk of what I’ve read has probably already escaped my cranium in a shower of cocktails and coffee. Maybe it’s time to dump my thoughts somewhere? Just like taking notes in college!</p>

<p>So I give you the first in what I hope to be a series of “notes on a book.” These are not book reviews, but rather a list of important points I took away from the book.</p>

<p>My first Seth Godin book, <em>The Big Red Fez</em>, amounts to a 30-minute read. It’s probably worth about $4, but he’s selling it for $8-10. More power to him! I used the local library to partake in the tome. The book is simply a series of quick critiques of numerous web page designs. On the left-hand page is a screenshot and a caption, on the right-hand page is Seth’s take.</p>

<p>The book was OK. It outlined many pretty obvious problems, but sometimes obvious things are not obvious until someone actually points them out. It was a good experience reading the book (remember, 30 minutes), but I wouldn’t recommend buying it.</p>

<p><b>On with the brain dump.</b> When I said “like taking notes in college,” I meant “ugly.”</p>

<p>Design every page with one primary objective.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Possibly box or highlight where you want the user to click.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t believe your own hype.</p>
<ul>
	<li>People are not stopping at your site because of you.  They are there to accomplish what your site proports to help them with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a different page for each important segment.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Send non-subscribers to a page about subscribing.</li>
	<li>Send first time folks to a welcome page.</li>
	<li>Send subscribers to advanced usage pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limit user input in terms of field quantity and ease of keyboard data entry (drop-down lists, anyone?).</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get a minimum and politely request more later.</li>
	<li>Autofill fields when at all possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Present useful alternativs on failed searches.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ten most searched for links.</li>
	<li>Discount pages.</li>
	<li>Etcâ€¦</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid digital metaphors.</p>

<p>Test the money paths frequently.</p>

<p>If the computer can do the work for the user, make the computer do the work.</p>

<p>Err on the side of simple.</p>

<p>Keep your promises.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you can't deliver what you promised when the user last clicked, at least tell her why.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understand why people visit your site (what is used most often) and make it as easy as possible for others to find the same content/features/functionality.</p>

<p>Be clear about cost.</p>

<p>Avoid long forms. If necessary:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Split them over multiple pages.</li>
	<li>Provide best guesses where possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Say “Thank You.”</p>

<p>Avoid forcing people to leave your site in order to register.</p>

<p>Don’t let advertising be a hurdle to user experience.</p>

<p>Make it easy for users to share your site with others.</p>

<p>Don’t display links to areas of the site that are not functioning as promised.</p>

<p>When sending email, make it about the user, not the web site.</p>

<p>When you screw up, have a sense of humor about it.</p>
