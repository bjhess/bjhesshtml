      <h1>
        The New World
      </h1>





<p>Just finished watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0402399/"><em>The New World</em></a>. There is sublime, there is transcendental, and then there is <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000517/">Terrence Malick</a>. To be sure, a Malick movie is not for all. But if one ever wants to see an example of film as art (in the painting sense), I can think of no director better than Malick. Some of the most beautiful work you’re ever going to see on the screen.</p>

<p>I have only seen two of Malick’s for directorial works: <em>The Thin Red Line</em> and <em>The New World</em>. I did not “get” <em>The Thin Red Line</em> until about 30 minutes after it was over. There were so many long shots, shots directed at seemingly nothing. Audio did not necessarily jive with what I was seeing on the screen. It was a shock to my system. It took a while to set in.</p>

<p>Thankfully in Malick’s old age his output has increased to about three movies per decade. <em>Tree of Life</em> is slated to release in 2007 or 2008. Strangely I’ve never seen the two movies released before <em>The Thin Red Line</em>: <em>Badlands</em> (1973) and <em>Days of Heaven</em> (1978). Here I come, Netflix.</p>

<p>(Oh, and Malick’s employment of the Das Rheingold: Overture by Wagner was stupendous. The piece basically sounds like the notes of Taps being played forward, backward, and inside-out. Extremely fitting for the end of the movie, and supremely interesting for the beginning of the film as we watch the settlers arrive in their new world.)</p>
