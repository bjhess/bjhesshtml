        Twins vs Tigers, March 11, 2006
      </h1>


      <em>Ed: Sorry, photos are broken.</em>


      <p><span class="caveat">Unfortunately the pictures are forever broken on this post.</span></p>

      <p>(See day two <a href="../../bjhessblog/index.html%3Fp=709.html">here</a>)</p>

      <p>We arrived at Lee County Sports Complex at 10AM as my research signified this as the start time for practice.
        We were so on point that we beat the parking lot attendants to their posts and did not need to pay for parking.
        Naturally we offered to pay when the attendants arrived, but our attempts were rebuffed.</p>

      <p>What awaited us was some good old-fashioned outdoor baseball.</p>

      <p><a href="http://bjhess.com/bjhessblogpictures/2006-03-11(09.03.46)_lg.jpg"

          The Wife and The Kid are ready for some baseball</a></p>

      <p>We first headed to field #5, directly west of the main stadium. This is where practice is located for players
        not scheduled to play the day’s game. Immediately we recognized Tom Kelly, Tony Oliva and Ron Gardenhire warming
        themselves up for practice as the team proper stretched and ran in the outfield.</p>

      <p><a href="http://bjhess.com/bjhessblogpictures/2006-03-11(09.13.00)_lg.jpg" title="Gardy lets the dogs out"><img

      <!--more-->
      <p>It was a fun environment as only the chainlink separated us from infield practice. We found the coaches quite
        obnoxious, playfully chiding the players every chance they got. Kelly was really giving it to the new second
        baseman, Luis Castillo, who was not getting in front of any ground balls due to his tender ankle. Gardy also had
        an interesting tactic of coming down on anyone who hit well off him in batting practice. I know it is “just a
        game,” but it seemed a little counterintuitive that he was hoping to strike out his players in batting practice.
      </p>

      <p>In the stadium, the team painted a couple “on deck circles” in honor of Kirby Puckett. Oh, that number.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.bjhess.com/bjhessblogpictures/2006-03-11(11.15.42)_lg.jpg" title="Ol' #34"><img

      <p>I did not notice the familiarity of this scene until I got home and started looking through my pictures. The
        Wife said “KDLT” and the memories flooded back. Interviewing Shannon Stewart is long time
        man-about-Sioux-Falls-South-Dakota, <a href="http://www.kdlt.com/bios.htm#biomarko">Mark Ovenden</a>. I’m pretty
        sure Ovenden has been a sports anchor for every news affiliate in Sioux Falls at one time or another. As a child
        of southwest Minnesota, he’s immediately recognizable to me. Weird.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.bjhess.com/bjhessblogpictures/2006-03-11(11.21.20)_lg.jpg"
          title="Shannon Stewart and Mark Ovenden"><img alt="Shannon Stewart and Mark Ovenden"

      <p>Before the game started I spied with my little eye Mr. Al Newman, now a scout for the Kansas City Royals. We
        were situated behind home plate and he was making his way out of the stadium. I pulled my recently purchased
        Twins logo ball out of my pocket as I asked The Wife to verify who we were seeing. Even though he had lost
        considerable weight, it was clearly Al Newman.</p>

      <p>I’m not one to aggressively attempt to grab autographs. It embarrasses me a little bit. I’m just generally
        introverted, so The Wife stepped in. “Hey, Al!” I believe she said. First name basis! Anyway, he
        semi-reluctantly signed for us. Actually, he bantered with us about stopping him on a “walk by signing.”
        All-in-all a pretty congenial little back-and-forth. I believe he signed one more item before escaping.</p>

      <p>The pitching matchup was a decent one (on paper) featuring Brad Radke versus Nate Robertson. Radke started the
        game off without allowing a run. What a wonderful thing. Unfortunately he did allow two runs in the second
        inning, but those runs became largely inconsequential. Well inconsequential unless you were hoping Radke would
        develop a distaste for the long ball this season. Yep, the runs scored on two (thankfully) solo homers.</p>

          Brad Radke gives it a whirl</a></p>

      <p>The offense was alive for the Twins on this day. Three home runs were hit, two by Rondell White and another by
        Tony “<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0104695/">The Evangelist</a>” Batista. The fans adored the power output,
        as I’m sure did the coaches.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.bjhess.com/bjhessblogpictures/2006-03-11(12.33.52)_lg.jpg"
          title="Rondell White looked good against his old team"><img

          Rondell White looked good against his old team</a></p>

      <p>Unfortunately, White’s home runs were both solo shots. I should have kept score - I forgot how pitiful the box
        scores are for preseason matchups. I seem to remember some negative things about all the scoring, but I could be
        confusing myself with the second game. In any case, when will Batista have hit poorly enough consistently enough
        for some team to force him into a real batting stance?</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.bjhess.com/bjhessblogpictures/2006-03-11(12.37.18)_lg.jpg"

      <p>It was certainly a fun game to watch as the Twins put out two 6-run innings. There were lots of Tiger fans as
        well and they were screaming for the manager to take out Robertson early on. The shouts fell on deaf ears,
        however, because starting pitchers are rarely taken out mid-inning in Spring Training play.</p>

      <p>And the game progressed. Outdoor baseball, a fun time any time. I will say that it got pretty hot in the packed
        stadium, and The under-two-year-old Kid probably could have done without baking so. For families with younger
        children I’d highly recommend booking tickets in the top 10 or so rows, especially on the third base side, for
        the shade provided. It’s not like they’re bad seats or anything. And I’ve decided I don’t really enjoy sitting
        behind the netting. My perfect seats would be right between the netting and the dugout - at least that’s what I
        think until I actually get to sit in such seats.</p>

      <p>We happened to park right next to the players parking lot exit. This also put us right next to Puckett Parkway.
      </p>

          Puckett signage</a></p>

      <p>From what I could tell, AAA and below players did not get the advantage of the fenced in parking. There were
        many techniques for players pulling out of the lot. Some players kind of ignored the fans or gave them a cursory
        look. Others definitely waived and smiled, but were not stopping. The cagey veterans (Shannon Stewart and Rueben
        Sierra, for instance) “talked” on their cell phones when leaving the lot with a quick wave.</p>

      <p>Lew Ford was flagged down on this day. He stopped his SUV, wife and child in tow, and began signing.
        Unfortunately for Joe Mauer and his chromed out Chrysler 300 (you heard me), he was stuck behind Ford and forced
        to sign away. I hustled over and got me a JM7 autograph to go with my Newman. I then approached Ford’s vehicle
        to find him and his wife having a detailed conversation with an older couple who obviously knew them. I listened
        in for a while as it was interesting hearing Ford talk about his golf game, but I wasn’t willing to interrupt
        their conversation. I made note of Ford’s severely damaged driver-side mirror, laughed to myself as anyone who
        knows Ford’s personality would, and moseyed back to my car.</p>

          JM7 and Newmie signed me a ball</a></p>

      <p>Pretty fun time, all-in-all. I highly recommend it. The boxscore trails this entry and I will post about the
        second game in our Spring Training visit later.</p>
