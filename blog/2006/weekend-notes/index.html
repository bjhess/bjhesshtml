      <h1>
        Weekend Notes
      </h1>





<p>My parents visited this weekend after we all attended my little sister’s gymnastics meet in Welcome. We went to the newly opened Owatonna <a href="http://pizzaranch.com">Pizza Ranch</a> on Saturday. It was my second time in two days. The pizza is good, not great or crave-worthy, but respectable. The broasted chicken is excellent. I just generally like Pizza Ranch when I’m in the mood to overeat.</p>

<p>I consider myself lucky to live near a Pizza Ranch. It is a small town chain. A really small town chain. Owatonna has to be in the top five in the city size to Pizza Ranch relationship. That’s probably even including the tourist populations of Spirit Lake/Okoboji, Iowa, and Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. If you’re ever in the mood to eat yourself into meat sweats…</p>

<p>My Dad and I watched a lot of beauteous football on the high def television. Naturally, “beauteous” isn’t entirely descriptive of the actual games. I couldn’t believe some of the bad football being played in the second round of the playoffs. I definitely couldn’t believe that said bad football was being played by the New England Patriots. Note to league: Don’t water-down football any more than you already have.</p>

<p>Oh, “beauteous” and “officiating” are no longer allowed in the same sentence when discussing the NFL.</p>

<p>I ordered some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAP">CPAP</a> equipment for my <a href="http://www.cpap.com/productpage/respironics-remstar-plus-cpap-cflex-heated-humidifier.html">REMstar Plus C-Flex</a> machine. From my initial scrounging, CPAP-related stuff costs about 60% as much on the Internet as it does at traditional medical supply stores. I still think my initial purchase was probably more appropriate through the designated B&amp;M locations, for insurance purposes, but the accessory purchases are a complete rip-off. Of course, there is always the risk that an air hose from The Internet wasn’t adequately tested resulting in The Wife finding me hanging from the ceiling fan when she awakes.</p>
