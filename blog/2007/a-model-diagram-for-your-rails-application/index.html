      <h1>
        A Model Diagram for Your Rails Application
      </h1>





<p>Recently I started working on a fairly large existing application. Lots of stuff going on, and I wanted a visualization of both the model and controller classes to make me feel that indeed the application could be encapsulated. In my search, I ran into two libraries that could help me do such a thing. The first was <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rav/">Rails Application Visualizer</a> and the second was <a href="http://railroad.rubyforge.org">Railroad</a>. Both use the <a href="http://graphviz.org">GraphViz</a> library to do the grunt work. I chose Railroad mainly because it was a gem and nonintrusive to the application.</p>

<p>The first requirement in using Railroad is to get GraphViz installed. Eventually I found this <a href="http://www.ryandesign.com/graphviz/">excellent series of Mac builds</a> from <a href="http://www.ryandesign.com">RyanDesign</a>. They are easily installed and he has a <a href="http://www.ryandesign.com/graphviz/faq.php">great FAQ</a> describing everything you need or may wish to do to setup the GraphViz library on your Mac.</p>

<p>Here is the process <em>I</em> went through:</p>

<h3 id="install_graphviz">Install GraphViz</h3>

<p>I downloaded the <a href="http://www.ryandesign.com/graphviz/">latest Intel Mac</a> build and installed it. For me, GraphViz ended up in <code>/usr/local/graphviz-2.12/</code>. Then I created a symlink:</p>

<code><pre><span class="ident">cd</span> <span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">usr</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">local</span>
<span class="ident">sudo</span> <span class="ident">ln</span> <span class="punct">-</span><span class="ident">s</span> <span class="ident">graphviz</span><span class="punct">-</span><span class="number">2.12</span> <span class="ident">graphviz</span>
</pre></code>

<p>Then I updated <code>~/.bash_profile</code> to bring GraphViz into my path. This allowed me to call <code>dot</code> and <code>neato</code> on the command line.</p>

<code><pre><span class="ident">export</span> <span class="constant">PATH</span><span class="punct">=/</span><span class="regex">usr</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">local</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">graphviz</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">bin</span><span class="symbol">:$PATH</span>
</pre></code>

<p>Finally, I reloaded bash so all the exports were refreshed:</p>

<code><pre><span class="ident">source</span> ~<span class="punct">/.</span><span class="ident">bash_profile</span>
</pre></code>

<h3 id="install_railroad">Install Railroad</h3>

<p>Pretty easy:</p>

<code><pre><span class="ident">gem</span> <span class="ident">install</span> <span class="punct">-</span><span class="ident">y</span> <span class="ident">railroad</span>
</pre></code>

<h3 id="generate_model_and_controller_diagrams">Generate model and controller diagrams</h3>

<p>After quite a bit of playing around, I settled on the following calls to generate my model and controller diagrams. My biggest hurdle is that I don’t have a way to tile print super-large PDF’s, given I’m only using base OSX tools (i.e. Preview). So these commands gave me the most printable output. Luckily I just bought a new laser printer!</p>

<p>Generating a model diagram:</p>

<code><pre><span class="ident">railroad</span> <span class="punct">-</span><span class="constant">Mal</span> <span class="punct">|</span> <span class="ident">dot</span> <span class="punct">-</span><span class="constant">Tpdf</span> <span class="punct">&gt;</span> <span class="ident">models</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">pdf</span>
</pre></code>

<p>The ‘M’ switch tells railroad to create a model diagram. The ‘a’ switch includes all models, not just <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> models. And the ‘l’ switch throws a label on the diagram about when it was created and which migration version it represents. The PDF diagram seemed cleanest and it printed decently on a single page - if I squint.</p>

<p>And a controller diagram:</p>

<code><pre> <span class="ident">railroad</span> <span class="punct">-</span><span class="constant">Cl</span> <span class="punct">|</span> <span class="ident">neato</span> <span class="punct">-</span><span class="constant">Tpng</span> <span class="punct">&gt;</span> <span class="ident">controllers</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">png</span>
</pre></code>

<p>On the other hand, the controller diagram did not work well in PDF. Since none of the controllers were interrelated, the results were a single “line” of controllers spreading out horizontally. Not printable. The PNG format fit all the classes onto a page rather nicely.</p>

<p>The Railroad site has plenty of <a href="http://railroad.rubyforge.org/#usage">good documentation</a> and <a href="http://railroad.rubyforge.org/#examples">examples</a> for you to play with. So why don’t you go visualize your app already?</p>
