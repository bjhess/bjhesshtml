      <h1>
        Anchor Tag and Element ID Standards
      </h1>





<p>Yesterday, I <a href="http://bjhess.com/bjhessblog/?p=1075">complained</a> about some markup issues I was having while developing <a href="http://www.scrawlers.com">Scrawlers.com</a>.</p>

<p>It appears that I was breaking HTML standards. The combined list of anchor names and element ID’s <em>should</em> be unique <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#h-12.2.3" rel="nofollow">according to W3C</a>. I find this a little confusing, but I can adjust.</p>

<p>It appears to me that element ID’s are meant to be a sort of alias that can be used like an anchor name (along with many other functions). I don’t get the sense that anchor names are meant to be aliases for element ID’s, however. I base that opinion on this statement in the spec, meant to describe why an anchor ID may be a better choice than an anchor name in some situations:</p>
<blockquote>The id attribute can act as more than just an anchor name.</blockquote>
<p>They did not say “the anchor name can act as more than just an anchor name.” :)</p>

<p>An interesting effect, brought to my attention via an email from a reader, is that one can use element ID’s in lieu of anchor names to link within documents. This means that I’ll be going through Scrawlers and eliminating a bunch of anchor tags, minimizing markup and accelerating page loads.</p>

<p>I still think IE6 could have degraded more elegantly. You know, like all the other browsers.</p>
