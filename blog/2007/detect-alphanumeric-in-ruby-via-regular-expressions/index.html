      <h1>
        Detect Alphanumeric in Ruby via Regular Expressions
      </h1>





      <p>I do not understand <a
          href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aregular+expressions&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">regular
          expressions</a>. It’s on my list to get to know them better and make some use of them to gain understanding,
        but I have not done it yet. It’s a deficiency that I am aware of.</p>

      <p>All I wished to do was verify that a user-keyed login and password were fully alphanumeric (including ‘<em>‘).
          I found <a href="http://www.juixe.com/techknow/index.php/2006/07/29/rails-model-validators/">one reference</a>
          out on the InterWeb, though there was a bug in that code. I went with the following validation code in my
          Rails model class:</em></p>

      <code>
        <pre><span class="ident">validates_format_of</span> <span class="symbol">:login</span><span class="punct">,</span> <span class="symbol">:password</span><span class="punct">,</span> <span class="symbol">:display_name</span><span class="punct">,</span>
                    <span class="symbol">:with</span> <span class="punct">=&gt;</span> <span class="punct">/</span><span class="regex">^<span class="escape">\w</span>+$</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">i</span><span class="punct">,</span>
                    <span class="symbol">:message</span> <span class="punct">=&gt;</span> <span class="punct">"</span><span class="string">can only contain letters and numbers.</span><span class="punct">"</span>

</pre></code>

      <p>Wow, do I look like an idiot posting this - what a breakthrough I must say! But understand there will be other
        idiots like me digging for the same solution. Hopefully those idiots will run into this post and be on their
        merry way.</p>

      <p>TextMate actually has <a href="http://macromates.com/textmate/manual/regular_expressions">a nice regular
          expression manual</a> online that aligns pretty well with Ruby’s implementation. I enjoyed looking at that a
        lot more than the Pragmatic Ruby Programming book.</p>
