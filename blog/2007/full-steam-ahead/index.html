        Full Steam Ahead
      </h1>





<p><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/237-fireside-chat-seth-godin-and-mark-hurst-part-1-of-2">Seth Godin at the 37signals blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>If I had to close this thing with one message to the 37s reader who is reading at work when she should[n't] be reading, and who is busy blaming her boss for the low bar and lousy service and the Dilbert world she lives in, it would be this:

TAKE RESPONSIBILITY! If there's a problem, fix it. If your job can't be fixed, quit. How dare you waste your life in exchange for a paycheck. You have high speed internet access, bub, you've got no excuse. You don't live a hovel in Ghana. Go do it!! Pick up the phone and call someone.</blockquote>
<p>This quote comes from someone with a blind spot. Godin may not appreciate the percentage of his, and anyone’s, success that is attributable to luck. His statements depict a snap decision that should work for everyone. Godin gives no context; no mention of the realities that surround the decisions one makes. There is a lot of work required to get oneself to the position where one can simply “Go do it.”</p>

<p>Problems aside, what Godin wrote is the most succinct description I’ve seen of the experience that led me to resign from my job two weeks ago. (And <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/02/dont_ask_employ.html">this article about passion</a> is an equally appropriate long description.) There was a problem with my career. There was a problem with the organization. I tried to fix it, or begin the process of fixing it. I spent six months trying to fix it. Eventually I felt confident that “it” was not fixable and I needed to move on.</p>

<p>Starting tomorrow I will be making use of my high speed internet access, as I have been over the past weeks, to build my resume and get in touch with people who have projects I want to work on. E-mails are flying from my place to their’s, and I’ve even picked up the phone a couple times. The future is unknown, but I’m confident an opportunity will present itself and I will be able to resume my career, taking a path of my own choosing.</p>

<p>I’m thankful for the past 6 1/2 years at my previous job. I met many wonderful people - lifelong friends. The experiences, both good and bad, shaped me into the professional I am today. At no time in my life have I had a better idea of the stuff I’m comprised of.</p>

<p>As The Brother said the day I announced my resignation to my family, “Full steam ahead!”</p>
