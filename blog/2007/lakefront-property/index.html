        Lakefront Property
      </h1>





      <p>We had a ton of rain over the past day, with downpours after midnight. A neighbor called at 1:30 this morning
        to warn us that “Lake Churchill” was in effect.</p>

      <p>Our new sump pump performed like a champ. The biggest worry was if the power went out. Then we were D-U-N,
        done.</p>

      <p>I decided to stay up while the flood warning was still in effect. Did some wiring in the basement and setup on
        my new “office.” I just checked on the water levels. They’ve receded, but not much. Just a few feet, really.</p>

      <p>It’s kind of weird. With all the watery sounds (eaves, water lapping at our lawn, etc), standing outside in the
        quiet really feels like I’m at a lake. Especially because there are many of the same telltale bug-noises in the
        air.</p>

      <p>More pictures <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bjhess/sets/72157601545430813/">at Flickr</a>. Excuse the
        blurriness. The pictures were taken at 2AM with a shutter speed of 1.6 seconds.</p>
