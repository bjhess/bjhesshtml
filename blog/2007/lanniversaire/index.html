        L'anniversaire
      </h1>





<p>This blog’s been around for three years. Yay bjhess blog!</p>

<p>In that time the blog has morphed from my personal half-baked musings on sports and politics to numerous posts linking to interesting stuff I’ve read on the ‘Net to pictures of my family to discussion on how I can get back on the personal growth train. The past year has seen me <a href="../../bjhessblog/2007/02/07/full-steam-ahead/index.html">reboot my career</a>, <a href="../../bjhessblog/2006/11/22/what-have-you-been-doing/index.html">recommit to learning</a>, and refocus on <a href="../../bjhessblog/2007/06/30/snapping-two/index.html">what’s important in my life</a>.</p>

<p>As the summer has progressed, this blog has featured my findings as I learn more and more about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and general application development in the wild. On the in-between-days I’ll put up something more <a href="../../bjhessblog/2006/11/22/what-have-you-been-doing/index.html">personal</a> or <a href="../../bjhessblog/2007/07/20/the-stuff-of-childhood-nightmares/index.html">fun</a>. Perhaps this will lead to a schism of the two trains of thought: a personal blog and a business blog. I’m not sure, but right now that sounds like a lot of time I don’t have.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, known and anonymous alike!</p>
