        Notes on a Book - Don't Make Me Think
      </h1>





<p>The latest book I read was a gem, pure and simple. I’ve read about usability with some frequency online and I’ve attended <a href="http://www.humanfactors.com/home/usability.asp">Human Factors</a> usability training. It turns out the best documentation on the whole web usability question is in the form of a short and sweet book by Steve Krug called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/sr=8-1/qid=1171426631/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-0508492-7572050?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><em>Don't Make Me Think</em></a>.</p>

<p>Definitely a must buy, <em>Don't Make Me Think</em> runs the gamut from name dropping <a href="../../bjhessblog/index.html%3Fp=1057.html">William Strunk</a> to explaining exactly why one would benefit from copying Amazon to just how to cheaply and easily make usability testing a part of every project. There’s a reason that this book costs as much on half.com as it does on Amazon.com: it’s that good.</p>

<p><strong>Brain Dump:</strong></p>

<p>Most important usability feature: Don’t make me think.</p>

<p>Happy talk must die:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid Self congratulatory promotional writing</li>
<li>Web users don't have time for small talk</li>
</ul>
<p>Omit needless words (Strunkism).</p>

<p>No one will read instructions unless your site sucks.</p>

<p>Navigation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps us find what we're looking for</li>
<li>Tells us where we are</li>
<li>Gives us something to hold on to - feel grounded</li>
<li>Tells us what is here</li>
<li>Tells us how to use the site - instructions</li>
<li>Gives us confidence in the people who built it</li>
</ul>
<p>Every page needs a name - highlights in navigation are not sufficient. (Name needs to match what was clicked.)</p>

<p>Make tabs look tabby.</p>

<p>Copy Amazon tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physically connect with space below.</li>
<li>Color code different sections.</li>
<li>Make sure a tab is selected at beginning of site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trunk test for good web navigation. On any page, answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What site is this? (Site ID)</li>
<li>What page am I on? (Page name)</li>
<li>What are the major sections of the site?</li>
<li>What are my options at this level? (Local navigation)</li>
<li>Where am I in the scheme of things?</li>
<li>How can I search?</li>
</ul>
<p>Convey the big picture on the home page. Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is this?</li>
<li>What can I do?</li>
<li>What do they have here?</li>
<li>Why should I be here versus somewhere else?</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid mission statement on home page.</p>

<p>Home page is one of the most important pages to test.</p>

<p>Get a good tagline.</p>

<p>Home page should show where to start if:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to search</li>
<li>I want to browse</li>
<li>I want to sample stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s OK for homepage to have different orientation from the rest of the site, though navigation should have commonalities.</p>

<p>The book contained too many excellent usability testing tips to count.</p>

<p>Accessibility low-hanging fruit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add appropriate alt text to every image</li>
<li>Make your forms work with screen readers (use label element)</li>
<li>Create "skip to main content" link at the beginning of each page</li>
<li>Make all content accessible by keyboard</li>
<li>Don't use JavaScript without good reason</li>
<li>Use client-side image maps</li>
</ul>
