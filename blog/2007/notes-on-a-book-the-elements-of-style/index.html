        Notes on a Book - the Elements of Style
      </h1>

      
    


<p><a href="http://product.half.ebay.com/Elements-of-Style_W0QQprZ12427QQtgZinfo"><em>The Elements of Style</em></a> may seem like an unusual choice of reading material for someone trying to improve his web development skills. But from a personal improvement aspect, the book was entirely appropriate. On top of that, the web site I’m working on is a <em>writing</em> web site, so having <em>the</em> style and grammar reference book on my shelf only makes sense.</p>

<p>I actually checked this book out from the library, but I just placed an order for it on half.com. It’s dry, no doubt, but often reference material is dry. Yet I think the book is a must read for anyone whose career depends in the least bit on writing. Whether one is writing a blog, 100-word story, or user scenario, clear and natural writing can be an outstanding skill to have.</p>

<p>It was difficult to take notes on a reference book, but there are a couple things I wrote down along the way.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../bjhessblog/index.html%3Fpage_id=1015.html">reading list</a> has been updated, natch.</p>

<p><strong>Brain dump:</strong></p>

<p>A tame passage of exposition can be made lively by using a transitive in an active voice.</p>
<ul>
<li><del datetime="2007-01-21T22:26:28+00:00">Thousands of people were walking toward the square.</del></li>
<li>Thousands of people enveloped the square.</li>
</ul>
<p>Write statements in positive form; even when the statements are negative.</p>
<ul>
<li><del datetime="2007-01-21T22:33:38+00:00">He did not want a lousy MP3 player.</del></li>
<li>He thought off-brand MP3 players were junk.</li>
<li><del datetime="2007-01-21T22:33:38+00:00">not intelligent</del></li>
<li>stupid, ignorant</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid introducing uncertainty (would, might) unless clearly appropriate.</p>

<p>Be specific, not generic.</p>

<p>Omit needless words. Every word should tell.</p>

<p>And a great William Strunk quote: Vigorous writing is concise.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus brain dump:</strong></p>

<p>I also paged through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/sr=8-1/qid=1169468081/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-5364703-3459945?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em></a>, though I was not inspired to read the book. By all accounts it’s a good book, but it just didn’t grab me. I may come back to it later when I have some more time for related, but perhaps not necessary, reading material. For now I plan to follow the <a href="http://webtypography.net/">Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web</a> project.</p>

<p>During my paging I found two helpful tips:</p>

<p>Typically paragraph indents occur in all but the first paragraph. The indent tends to be of about 1 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)">em</a>. The reason for this is that a paragraph indent is designed to depict separation. The first paragraph of a section/chapter/whatever is usually separated from the header or description preceding it.</p>

<p>When typing abbreviations or acronyms within the flow of text, use small caps. The exceptions are two-letter geographic acronyms, like MN, and acronyms that represent personal names, such as JFK.</p>
