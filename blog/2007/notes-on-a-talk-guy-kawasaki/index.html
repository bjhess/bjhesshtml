        Notes on a Talk - Guy Kawasaki
      </h1>





<p>On Friday, Nate and I attended a presentation given by Guy Kawasaki. The event was held at the <a href="http://www.alumnicenter.umn.edu/">McNamara Alumni Center</a> at the University of Minnesota. There were approximately 500-600 folks in attendance - pretty much a full house. Additional attendees watched a simulcast at the Carlson School of Management on the left bank.</p>

<p>Kawasaki is a pretty engaging speaker, and he included a good helping of humor and self deprecation with the mounds of useful ideas he presents. The crowd was a mixed bag of success, superficial success, those sucking up to success and those simply hoping for success. There was not a ton of new information for me as Kawasaki echoes a lot of the writing about startups that can be found on the ‘Net. I have not read the book this speech was based on, <em>The Art of the Start</em>, but I imagine it is worthwhile if not groundbreaking.</p>

<p><strong>On with the brain dump:</strong></p>

<p>A mantra is more important than a mission statement. An example given for Target: “Democracy of Design.” Kawasaki’s point is that a mantra is more powerful because it’s inspiring and it’s something that can be remembered, unlike a mission statement. Scrawlers: “Writers read. Writers write.”</p>

<p>Get going. Don’t wait for the perfect moment.</p>

<p>Polarize people. You’re on to something if the public has a love-hate relationship with your product (e.g. the Mac).</p>

<p>Think different. Don’t try to recreate someone else’s success.</p>

<p>Work with soul mates. Surround yourself with people who will help pick each other up.</p>

<p>Your business model should be simple, especially when presenting to potential investors. When getting user feedback, ask women. Kawasaki was very adamant that women have a strong say in the design of a product. I won’t get into it, but he talked a lot about the man’s innate disposition to kill. It was a humorous segment of the presentation, but there is a grain of truth in there I think.</p>

<p>Recognize these important pieces of success:</p>

<ul>
<li>Milestones - something you can tell your spouse (e.g. “We shipped today”).</li>

<li>Assumptions - test your assumptions. Many people don’t actually verify their assumptions.</li>

<li>Tasks - these are designed to get you closer to a milestone or test an assumption.</li>
</ul>
