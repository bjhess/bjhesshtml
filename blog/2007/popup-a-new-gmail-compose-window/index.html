<p>With a goal to adhere to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">GTD</a> method, along with a mind to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307353133/">reduce my email checking to twice a day</a>, I realized I needed a way to send an email without actually visiting Gmail.
