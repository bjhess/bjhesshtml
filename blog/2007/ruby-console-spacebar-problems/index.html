        Ruby Console Spacebar Problems
      </h1>





<p>Since early this summer, I have had a severely annoying problem with my Ruby consoles (irb and script/console). My spacebar quit functioning, making quick testing of Ruby and Rails functionality quite limited and in some cases impossible. I’ll give you two versions of my story. First the short version.</p>

<p>Long, long ago I installed my Mac OS X Rails environment as described in the excellent <a href="http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx">Hivelogic instructions</a>, written by Dan Benjamin. Life was good and my environment was isolated in <a href="http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/using_usr_local"><code>/usr/local</code></a>. But then in June the spacebar stopped working and I became unhappy. I tried posting the problem to a few Ruby targeted groups, both <a href="http://ruby.mn/">near</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk">far</a>, but no one had a suggestion.</p>

<p>After lots of head-banging (not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headbanging">this kind</a>, unfortunately), I solved the problem by removing my <code>/usr/local</code> version of <a href="http://www.rtr.com/winpak/Documentation/readline.htm">readline</a>, which I installed through the Hivelogic instructions. These are the files I removed:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/usr/local/include/readline</code></li>

<li><code>/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/i686-darwin8.10.1/readline.bundle</code></li>

<li><code>/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/i686-darwin8.8.3/readline.bundle</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Since the Hivelogic instructions explicitly connect the Ruby install with the <code>/usr/local</code> version of readline, I needed to recompile Ruby. These steps assume you did not remove the original source you downloaded when installing Ruby at the outset:</p>

<code><pre><span class="ident">cd</span> <span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">usr</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">local</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">src</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">ruby</span><span class="punct">-</span><span class="number">1.8</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="number">6</span>
<span class="ident">make</span> <span class="ident">distclean</span>
<span class="punct">./</span><span class="regex">configure --prefix=</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">usr</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">local</span> <span class="punct">--</span><span class="ident">enable</span><span class="punct">-</span><span class="ident">pthread</span> <span class="punct">--</span><span class="ident">enable</span><span class="punct">-</span><span class="ident">shared</span>
<span class="ident">make</span>
<span class="ident">sudo</span> <span class="ident">make</span> <span class="ident">install</span>
</pre></code>

<p>Notice in the ./configure line I did not include the <code>--with-readline-dir=/usr/local</code> switch shown in the Hivelogic instructions. (If you have deleted the Ruby source files, merging the above with the Hivelogic instructions should get things done for you.)</p>

<p>Recently a similar issue appeared with my MySQL console. I suppose that’s the next hurdle.</p>

<p>I tried to resolve this spacebar problem a couple times in the past few months, but recently I became motivated to finally remove this monkey from my back. I <a href="http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?pid=42385#p42385">posted something</a> to the great Rails forum, which was the first community that offered some ideas.</p>

<p>First I logged in to OS X under The Wife’s account and found that irb did not have any spacebar issues. Useful information. In my local account, I tried running irb under the csh, tcsh, and zsh shells, and it had the same problem throughout. Thanks to <a href="http://www.scidept.com/">B.J. Clark</a> for those ideas.</p>

<p>So then I dug into my <code>~/.bash_profile</code> file, eliminating line-by-line until I made my irb spacebar problem go away. I found that if I changed this export statement:</p>

<code><pre><span class="ident">export</span> <span class="constant">PATH</span><span class="punct">="</span><span class="string">/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH</span><span class="punct">"</span>
</pre></code>

<p>To this (by removing <code>/usr/local/bin</code>):</p>

<code><pre><span class="ident">export</span> <span class="constant">PATH</span><span class="punct">="</span><span class="string">/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH</span><span class="punct">"</span>
</pre></code>

<p>The irb spacebar problems went away again. Thanks to <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Ryan Bates</a> for that tip.</p>

<p>Naturally, if I remove <code>/usr/local/bin</code> from my PATH, I’m reverting to OS X’s default Ruby and irb binaries. This is not really a solution; I need a later version of Ruby on the system. Something must be corrupted in my <code>/usr/local</code> area.</p>

<h3 id="many_tries_at_reinstalling_ruby">Many tries at reinstalling Ruby</h3>

<p>Thinking I just needed a freshly minted version in place, I tried reinstalling several versions of Ruby in a couple different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reinstalled ruby-1.8.6.tar.gz</li>

<li>Didn’t help</li>

<li>Installed ruby-1.8.6-p110.tar.gz</li>

<li>Didn’t help</li>

<li>Installed ruby-1.8.5-p114.tar.gz</li>

<li>Didn’t help</li>

<li>Installed via <a href="http://rubyosx.rubyforge.org/">one-click installer</a> (1.8.6, patchlevel 0 - just like Hivelogic)</li>

<li>Didn’t help</li>
</ul>

<p>For “fun,” I copied over the default version of Ruby (<code>/usr/bin/ruby</code>) over to <code>/usr/local/bin/ruby</code>. This eliminated the spacebar problem, but it still just was not a solution. Since my install of OS X has Ruby version 1.8.2, I tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installed ruby-1.8.2.tar.gz</li>

<li>Didn’t help</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s when I started thinking it wasn’t a Ruby issue. Yes, I know I’m a genius so don’t bother commenting along those lines. Perhaps it was an irb binary issue. Again, I copied over the default version of irb to <code>/usr/local/bin/irb</code>. Spacebar problems disappeared. However, script/console failed, and command history was unavailable (that’s what readline is for).</p>

<h3 id="crazy_little_thing_called_readline">Crazy little thing called readline</h3>

<p>Next I reverted back to the proper <code>/usr/local</code> irb binary and called with <code>irb --noreadline</code>. The spacebar worked again, this time using my original <code>/usr/local</code> version of irb and Ruby.</p>

<p>Thinking it must be a readline problem, I upgraded readline to 5.2 and even reinstalled Ruby 1.8.6. In this case, irb with readline still did not recognize my spacebar.</p>

<p>Confident that readline was the issue, I happened on the solution outlined at the beginning of this article. I imagine this sends me back to the OS X system default readline. <em>Technically</em> I no longer have control over all stuff that’s being used in my coding environment. But I think I’ll leave it be for now. Readline is low-impact, and it really seems unlikely that I’ll be needing the latest and greatest version anytime soon. My guess is the problem is in some specific OS X configuration thing that needs to be done when compiling readline, and frankly I just don’t have the energy.</p>
