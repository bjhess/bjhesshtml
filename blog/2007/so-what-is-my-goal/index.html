      <h1>
        So What Is My Goal?
      </h1>





<p>My general goal in <a href="../../bjhessblog/index.html%3Fp=1066.html">leaving my previous job</a> was to find a place working for myself in the web development area. Since that time I’ve been trying to analyze this goal in a little more detail. I’ve found that the type of work I want to be doing falls into priority order like so:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Work on my own projects.</li>

	<li>Work on an interesting product for another organization.</li>

	<li>Work with a small group of like-minded consultants on interesting third-party projects.</li>

 	<li>Work alone on a web application for another company.</li>

	<li>Work alone on a static website for another company.</li>
</ol>
<p>These goals aren’t set in stone. For instance, as I gain more experience and comfort with my new world, I imagine that point #4 may rise. Currently I am focused on gaining employment that gives me the experience and network to beget more and more exciting opportunities in the future.</p>

<p>Point #5 is one that I never see rising on this list. In fact, I’m not even sure if it belongs on the list. I don’t feel too excited about generating static web sites at this point in my career, and I’m not sure that there is even a career to be made out of it. Well, sure, one could build a critical mass of clients to make it work, but that definitely sounds more like a marketing job than a tech job.</p>

<p>I don’t think my list is that unusual. I’m sure there are a vast number of people out there who would love to spend their days working on projects of their own choosing. Or at the very least they would like to work on something exciting. For most people, the definition of exciting is aligning personal interests with work life, and for me the best way to do this is by generating the product ideas myself.</p>
