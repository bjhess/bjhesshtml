        Specifying Date When Blogging From TextMate to WordPress
      </h1>





<p>Friday was a day of Mac-fu. I spent the entire day getting more familiar with some tools and attempting to automate various repetitive tasks. I didn’t get very far, unfortunately, but the groundwork has been laid. OS X rocks.</p>

<p><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> is an amazing editor with amazing bundles snapped on to it. One of these bundles is for blogging. Why do I hop to my browser to blog when I have a glorious text editor right on my desktop that will accept Markdown formatting, grab categories directly from my blog, and upload pictures with a drag and a drop on the page?</p>

<p>The biggest problem I have with TextMate blogging is date stamping. I could throw an alternative date on my post pre-submission and it just was not recognized by WordPress. Something was lost in translation. Wiki-support to the rescue! TextMate <a href="http://macromates.com/wiki/Blogging/WordPress">fixes the problem</a> fairly simply for me.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I did receive an error when executing the provided patch against WordPress’s xmlrpc.php file:</p>

<pre><code>patching file xmlrpc.php
Hunk #1 succeeded at 692 with fuzz 1 (offset 23 lines).
Hunk #2 FAILED at 763.
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file xmlrpc.php.rej </code></pre>
