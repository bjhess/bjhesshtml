      <h1>
        Taking Notes and Checking Them Twice
      </h1>





<p>For a long while I have struggled with how to take notes on my work and personal activities. Working in the <a href="http://www.scrawlers.com">world of the web</a>, I find it a requirement to keep track of programming code snippets, step-by-step processes, or various ideas that pop into my head. I also struggle with detailed household tasks, like setting up financial things and researching the best options for various projects.</p>

<p>Initially, I simply did not take notes. I didn’t feel there was a lot of benefit in it, and I may have been right at the time. Over the past year, I have used a hidden WordPress blog to keep notes around for future reference. It is referenced semi-frequently, but it certainly isn’t the most convenient method of writing, <a href="../../bjhessblog/2007/04/30/specifying-date-when-blogging-from-textmate-to-wordpress/index.html">TextMate blogging-fu aside</a>. Honestly, tracking this stuff in a blog is not that hard, but I still wonder how many things I didn’t write down due to inconvenience factors?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/">Automator</a>, with a dash of <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>, to the rescue! My plan of attack was to find a way to, at the press of a key, create a text file by specifying a name and then save the file in the appropriate location. I ended up with a bit more than I planned for, not that I’m complaining!</p>

<p><img src="../../bjhessblog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/automator-creating-a-text-file.png" alt="Automator creating a text file"></p>

<p>Above is one example of an Automator script to generate a text file. I created six of these scripts, for things like code, career, household and financial notes. The biggest bonus I did not expect was renaming the file with a categorical tag, like “prog” or “idea,” in parentheses. Ultimately, I also include the .txt extension on the renaming rule so that I could enter things very Mac-like in the new file dialog box - without an extension.</p>

<p>I added OS X labeling (coloring) simply because I could. I considered adding <a href="http://www.adamrice.org/eponymous/2005/05/add_spotlight_t.html">half-baked tagging</a>, but I don’t see any benefit in my case. I’d like to be able to order things by tags to help in discovery. (Not that I don’t appreciate something better than <em>unbaked</em> tagging.) Each script is then tied to a Quicksilver trigger so I get that “press of a key” thing I was going for. New notes are placed in one of two folders in my Documents area: coding or personal.</p>

<p>There are a couple hitches in this process. First, if I happen to name a file identically to a previous note, and if it is placed in the same category, the prior note will be nuked. Not very excellent. Also, spotlight content search should be reasonably sufficient, but I do like seeing some context in my search results. <a href="http://desktop.google.com">Google Desktop</a> may be the answer to this problem. Oh, and there’s the whole matter of getting those blog notes into my new format…</p>
