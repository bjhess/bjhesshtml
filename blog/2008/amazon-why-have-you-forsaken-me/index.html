        Amazon, Why Have You Forsaken Me?
      </h1>

      
    


<p>Today’s customer support email to a company I actually like.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am trying to “Subscribe &amp; Save” to several items on your site. I was brought to the “Subscribe &amp; Save” idea through your flyer in a previous order:</p>

<ul>
<li>“FREE SHIPPING on all orders”</li>

<li>“All Subscribe &amp; Save orders ship for free. Always.”</li>
</ul>

<p>So I went to your site looking for things to subscribe to. Seemed convenient! Unfortunately the guaranteed free shipping on <em>all</em> orders is clearly either not working or a lie in advertising. I doubt Amazon would blatantly lie, so I’m wondering what’s wrong?</p>

<p>Basically, if I subscribe to any products under $25, the free shipping is not registering. Example products:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Mach3-Refill-Cartridges-8-Count/dp/B000277P5E/ref=sr_1_20?ie=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;s=grocery&amp;qid=1200358127&amp;sr=1-20">Gillette Mach3 Refill</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Sonicare-Replacement-Standard-2-Pack/dp/B00008BFXL/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=hpc&amp;qid=1200358449&amp;sr=8-1">Philips Sonicare Replacement Heads</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I scoured your <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=rcxsubs_details_faq?ie=UTF8&amp;node=200121950">FAQ</a> and I have not seen anything specifying that a product must qualify for Super Saving shipping to be shipped free under “Subscribe &amp; Save.” In all of Amazon’s written documentation on the “Subscribe &amp; Save” program, it is very explicit about there being free shipping on all orders and that there are no hidden fees and no penalties.</p>

<p>So, my question is why is the confirmation form saying I will be charged for shipping on “Subscribe &amp; Save” subscriptions under $25?</p>
<hr>
<p>I first called Amazon. Eventually the CSR tired of me. When I gave him the choice of either (a) Amazon’s system is botched or (b) Amazon is lying in their advertising, he said that Amazon was lying. I actually think its something more subtle. Like perhaps under $25 “Subscribe &amp; Save” orders are free shipping only on shipments following the first one. I could see this being done to keep people from subscribing to get free shipping and then immediately cancelling the subscription.</p>
