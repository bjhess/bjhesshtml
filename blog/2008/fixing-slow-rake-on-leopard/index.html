      <p><strong>Update:</strong> I highly recommend going with <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby
          Enterprise Edition</a> and <a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2009/04/09/ruby-gc-tuning/">Evan
          Weaver's Ruby GC settings</a> for much improved Ruby speed.</p>

      <p>In the past few months, as a result of <a
          href="../../bjhessblog/2008/01/18/superduper-is-my-savior/index.html">my clumsiness</a>, I’ve been working on
        a new, Leopard-enabled MacBook. When replacing my wet and dying Tiger MacBook of yore, my one hope was that my
        daily executions of rake to test <a href="http://getharvest.com">Harvest</a> would execute a little faster. A
        20% increase in processor speed doesn’t <a
          href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/858-the-macbook-air-could-easily-be-the-only-machine">buy one a
          whole</a> lot when web programming. The one place I figured I’d see a bump is the constant processor use of
        rake.</p>

      <p>Wrong. So, so, wrong.</p>

      <p>After moving to a new MacBook with Leopard installed, I experienced a test suite that ran 2-3 times
        <em>slower</em> than on my old machine. This became the difference between testing frequently and hardly at all;
        the difference between using and not using <a
          href="http://nubyonrails.com/articles/autotest-rails">autotest</a>. Pain to the max.</p>

      <p>This post is going to get long, so I’m going to reveal now. For me, the issue was resolved by leaving the <a
          href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/2008/02/ruby-rails-leopard">canonical Hivelogic world</a> and reverting to
        the default Leopard installation of Ruby. Test speed returned to better-than-normal, and all at the price of
        only 6 hours of troubleshooting!</p>

      </h3>

      <p>As always, my first suspicion was MySQL. I looked through my local Rails logs for particularly slow calls into
        MySQL. The initial thought was that a few bad-apple tests were not tuned very well for my environment. What I
        found was everything was slow and there were too many noticeably poor speeds to point to a few SQL calls as the
        culprits.</p>

      <p>Next I compared my <code>my.cnf</code> file to my <a href="http://deezsombor.com/">compadre</a>‘s. I noticed no
        major smells in my file. Since I’m a DB dummy, more important was Dee’s estimation that indeed my configuration
        file looked alright. We even went so far as comparing MySQL variables from within the MySQL shell:</p>
      <pre>mysql&gt; show variables;
</pre>
      <p>Finally, I upgraded MySQL from 5.0.51 to 5.0.51b and reinstalled the ruby-mysql gem. No dice.</p>

      <h3 id="sanity_check_benchmark_the_macbook">Sanity check: Benchmark the MacBook</h3>

      <p>Dee suggested I verify that my new MacBook itself wasn’t a lemon. I was doubtful since I’d noticed no other
        areas where it performed worse than its predecessor. Still, this was a great place to regroup. Benchmarking each
        MacBook put my mind in the right place to finish off my troubleshooting and uncover my problem.</p>

      <p>I used <a href="http://xbench.com/">Xbench</a> to compare the general performance of my new and old MacBooks.
        Benchmark results favored the new machine everywhere except OpenGL. After reading the <a
          href="http://db.xbench.com/faq.xhtml">FAQ</a>, it’s pretty clear OpenGL is a false positive for the old
        MacBook.</p>

      <h3 id="rails_a_general_comparison_between_two_machines">Rails: A general comparison between two machines</h3>

      <p>So I knew Rails was running slow when hitting the DB, but what about all by itself? I simply ran <code>rake
          environment</code> on both laptops and took a mental count. The command took ~3 seconds on the old machine and
        6-7 seconds on the new one.</p>

      <p>This was really enough, but I did run some model finders in each environment as a sort of sanity check.
        Performance results were in line with everything you’ve read so far.</p>

      <h3 id="ruby_activerecordless_and_slow_as_ever">Ruby: ActiveRecord-less and slow as ever</h3>

      <p>To hit the real meat-and-potatoes, I executed some Ruby-only code on both systems, benchmarking the whole way.
        Old Tiger:</p>

      <code>

      <p>New Leopard:</p>

      <code>
        <pre><span class="global">$ </span><span class="ident">ruby</span> <span class="ident">script</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">performance</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">benchmarker</span> <span class="punct">"</span><span class="string">(1..100).inject(1){|sum, n| sum*n}</span><span class="punct">"</span>

</pre></code>

      <p>Over six times slower. New shit has come to light!</p>

      <h3 id="sanity_check_ii_another_system_test">Sanity check II: Another system test</h3>

      <p>I wanted to run something from the command line that proved the new hotness was outperforming the old hoopty.
        Enter a little shell script built to copy an empty file to and from a folder 10,000 times:</p>

      <code>
        <pre><span class="comment">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="ident">echo</span> <span class="punct">"</span><span class="string">start at `date +%s`</span><span class="punct">"</span>

<span class="ident">exit</span> <span class="number">0</span>
</pre></code>

      <p>Rejoice! The new machine took 32 seconds to execute. The old one executed in 78 seconds. The winnowing process
        was imperfect, but I believe a winner has been crowned: Ruby.</p>

      <h3 id="ruby_from_source_to_simple">Ruby: From source to simple</h3>

      <p>Both machines in question were on Ruby 1.8.6. The new one on patchlevel 114, the old one on 0. I attempted to
        install Ruby from source for patchlevel 230 (ACK!) and 111. No rake performance improvements were achieved. I
        also own a Leopard Mac Mini, installed from the Hivelogic instructions, and experienced the same rake downfalls
        (Sanity check III). Time to try Leopard’s default Ruby (patchlevel 114).</p>

      <p>I did not want to remove <code>/usr/local/bin</code> from my path because I have other wonderful things
        installed there. Advisable or not, I simply renamed key binaries:</p>

      <code>
        <pre><span class="ident">mv</span> <span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">usr</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">local</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">bin</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">ruby</span> <span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">usr</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">local</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">bin</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">ruby</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">bak</span>
<span class="ident">mv</span> <span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">usr</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">local</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">bin</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">rake</span> <span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">usr</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">local</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">bin</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">rake</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">bak</span>
<span class="ident">mv</span> <span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">usr</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">local</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">bin</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">irb</span> <span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">usr</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">local</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">bin</span><span class="punct">/</span><span class="ident">irb</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">bak</span>
</pre></code>

      <p>From there, all my gems needed reinstalled. <code>gem install</code> failed on my first try, but worked
        thereafter. The ruby-mysql gem had <a
          href="http://blog.bmn.name/index.php/2008/02/17/rails-gem-install-mysql-throws-error-extconfrb-failed/">special
          needs</a> (assuming a Hivelogic-style install of MySQL), which were addressed with:</p>
      <pre>sudo gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config
</pre>
      <p>rake clean. Barry happy.</p>

      <p>I can’t say I’m comfortable browsing my filesystem for gem source like I was with <code>/usr/local</code>, but
        I imagine that will come with time. My suspicion is the Hivelogic instructions can still work in Leopard given
        the appropriate compilation switches. I’m not the person to provide such information - perhaps someone already
        has?</p>
