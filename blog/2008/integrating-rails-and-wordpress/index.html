      <h1>
        Integrating Rails and WordPress
      </h1>



      <p><a href="http://www.scrawlers.com">Scrawlers</a>, an online writing workshop I helped build, includes a <a
          href="http://blog.scrawlers.com">blog</a>. Rather than build the blog from scratch, or even use a Rails
        solution, I chose to stick with the familiarity of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. I’d read
        enough about Rails-lovers switching to a Rails-based engine and back to WordPress that I wasn’t even going to
        bother leaving The WP.</p>

      <p>Scrawlers sits on an Ubuntu server with Apache and Mongrel running. Unfortunately I have little to no server
        admin skill, and that includes Apache mod_rewrite. Ilya Grigorik <a
          href="http://www.igvita.com/2007/07/04/integrating-wordpress-and-rails/">posted</a> an excellent HOWTO on
        integrating WordPress and Rails. Unfortunately it didn’t <em>quite</em> work for Scrawlers, and I put off
        figuring out my special mod_rewrite secret sauce for quite a while.</p>

      <p>Eventually I figured out what I needed beyond Ilya’s original technique and posted it in the comments section
        of his blog. The completist in me needs to post the solution on my blog as well. What follows is pretty much
        word-for-word from Ilya’s comment section. Be sure to read <a
          href="http://www.igvita.com/2007/07/04/integrating-wordpress-and-rails/">his post</a>. It’s an easier
        solution, if it works for you, and it provides background information for what follows.</p>

      <p>I’m dealing with Apache configuration that I do not understand. So it turns out I have <a
          href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#allowoverride">AllowOverride</a> disabled on my server,
        even explicitly in my app-specific Apache configuration for the public directory. This is why
        <code>.htaccess</code> wasn’t working for me.</p>

      <p>After reading up a bit on <code>.htaccess/AllowOverride</code>, I decided there was really no reason to turn it
        on and eat the overhead involved. Instead I made a Directory directive in my app-specific config file and placed
        it before my initial WordPress redirects.</p>

      <p>Once these things were in place, the one-line RewriteRule worked in every instance except one. The URL
        <code>http://www.scrawlers.com/blog</code> (or <code>/blog/</code>) failed with an access denied error. Looking
        at the rules it sure appeared like it should work. In the end I needed to include a couple rules specific to
        these situations. Here is, essentially, the bit of configuration code I needed to make my blog start working
        naturally:</p>
      <script src='http://gist.github.com/291457.js'></script>
      <p>I’d explain each line in detail, but truthfully I can’t. I did a lot of <a
          href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/misc/rewriteguide.html">reading</a> in the Apache 2 manual, especially
        on the rewrite engine, to get the little bit I needed in place.</p>

        var idcomments_post_id = '1254';
        var idcomments_post_url;
      </script>

        <span id="IDCommentsPostTitle" style="display:none"></span>
