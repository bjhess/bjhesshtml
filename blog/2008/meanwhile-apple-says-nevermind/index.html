        Meanwhile, Apple Says "Nevermind"
      </h1>





<p>Assuming my main machine <a href="../../bjhessblog/2008/01/18/superduper-is-my-savior/index.html">comes back to life</a>, I’m not planning on upgrading it to OS X Leopard. Too many headaches for something that’s not broken (again, we’re talking about the OS here!).</p>

<p>One advantage of having an “old” OS X Tiger machine is that it includes Safari 2, rather than the new Safari 3 on Leopard. As a web application developer, it’s nice to have Safari 2 <em>and</em> Safari 3 available to me. Since I have a <a href="../../bjhessblog/2008/01/07/two-macs-no-problem/index.html">Mac Mini</a> with Safari 3, it appeared I had the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Apple wants me to upgrade my OS X Tiger version to version <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306297">10.4.11</a>, which includes a forced install of Safari 3. While I knew this was a long shot, I figured I’d call my newly minted AppleCare line to ask Apple how I can keep my OS X install up-to-date with out bringing in Safari 2. The representative said she knew of no way around Safari 3, but suggested I post to the Apple support forums.</p>

<p>And so I did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there a good way to take the 10.4.11 OS X update without taking Safari 3? I use my MacBook for software development, and would like to keep Safari 2 on this machine for testing. I have a Mac Mini with Leopard for testing on Safari 3.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Did a search but couldn’t find anything pertinent.</p>

<p>TIA!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were a couple of replies. One seemed too “might-worky” and the other just seemed like too much work with too much opportunity to bork my machine.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when I then received this email from Apple.</p>

<p>Nevermind, Apple. Maybe I should just disregard Safari 2 as you apparently have?</p>
