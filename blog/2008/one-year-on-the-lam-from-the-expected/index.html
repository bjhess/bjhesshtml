      <h1>
        One Year on the Lam From the Expected
      </h1>





<p>Today is the one-year anniversary of me <a href="../../bjhessblog/2007/02/07/full-steam-ahead/index.html">stepping out on my own</a>. Frankly, it blows my mind that it has already been a year. What a leap I took! I’m nothing but happy with the decision, even if I’m not exactly where I hoped to be at the one-year mark.</p>

<p>I’m proud to say I’ve spent all of my time doing work from the two top items on the <a href="../../bjhessblog/2007/02/13/so-what-is-my-goal/index.html">list of goals</a> I published last February. Number two on my prioritized work list was “Work on an interesting product for another organization.” In September I was able to do a few weeks of work in helping launch TurfWar, a Minnesota-based fantasy football startup. Unfortunately TurfWar had to close up shop early this football season, but hopefully they’ll be back again in 2008.</p>

<p>A large majority of my work in 2007 was done for <a href="http://iridesco.com/">Iridesco</a>, a great design studio in New York City. I believe I ran into the Iridesco job posting at <a href="http://rubynow.com/">rubynow.com</a>. A month passed before I received a response from them. I was impressed with what I knew of their little app that could, <a href="http://www.getharvest.com">Harvest</a>. Iridesco wasn’t looking for someone to work on Harvest, but rather work with their shortlist of clients.</p>

<p>This was a fine way to start out, and I put in a half-time schedule with Iridesco from March to August. We did some <a href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant</a> work for <a href="http://www.twc.org/">Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative</a>, an excellent literary arts education organization. I’m proud of the time I spent improving and enhaning the <a href="http://afs.org/">AFS Intercultural Programs</a> web site. Iridesco built an expansive content management system for AFS, and we made a lot of great improvements for them in 2007.</p>

<p>In September, Iridesco and I stepped up our relationship with the release of <a href="http://worldclockproject.org/">The World Clock Project</a>. I’ll admit, this web site is clearly a feat of design, and not necessarily programming. But I’m happy to have helped deliver the site in around a couple of weeks. Gotta love Ruby on Rails! In any case, if you have some interesting clock photos, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/worldclockproject/">please contribute</a>!</p>

<p>I had been patiently waiting for seven months when I began working on Harvest in October. We have an <a href="http://www.plasticity.com/">amazing</a> <a href="http://www.jiayo.net/">team</a> of <a href="http://deezsombor.com/">four</a> working on Harvest now. It boggles my mind what can be accomplished with such a small group these days. I’ve been involved in <a href="http://news.getharvest.com/articles/2008/01/07/interface-update-reports">some</a> <a href="http://news.getharvest.com/articles/2008/01/25/display-your-hours-in-decimal-or-hh-mm-format">useful</a> <a href="http://news.getharvest.com/articles/2008/01/29/log-into-harvest-with-openid">enhancements</a> to Harvest, and even some <a href="http://news.getharvest.com/articles/2008/01/07/new-feature-expense-tracking">big-time changes</a>. The future is bright for Harvest and Iridesco - I’m thankful to be a part of it.</p>

<p>Above I linked to a long-ago published work-priority list. If you remember, number one on that list was “Work on my own projects.” I must admit that I’ve neglected this goal. Well, I’ve certainly covered one important project - <a href="../../bjhessblog/2007/05/15/we-have-two/index.html">family</a>. In the time before my jump to the corporate world, I was pulling double-duty. While working the 40-hour gig, I was learning, learning, learning to jump. All the while I was neglecting the family a little more than I’d prefer.</p>

<p>The past year has found me reveling in the return of that block of after-hours time. I couldn’t help but feel 45-hours per week were enough. As a freelancer, the amount of time spent on job-like activities always outweighs billable hours by a decent margin. I’ve struggled with fitting personal projects into the schedule, and I’ll admit <a href="http://www.scrawlers.com">Scrawlers</a> has suffered from the situation. Scrawlers now has a <a href="http://blog.scrawlers.com">kick-ass blog</a> to go with a flagging site. I’d like to improve that balance.</p>

<p>I hope to remedy this situation over the next few months, but I make no promises. I still somewhat believe that work spent now on such high-equity projects will eventually pay off in vast swaths of time reclaimed down the road. Yet in these formative kids-at-home-all-day years, it’s kind of hard to justify the lost time. I’ve waited this long and maybe it would be best to get the kids into school before I dip all of my appendages in the water?</p>

<p>So The Next Year of Freelance will see me trying to solve this time-allocation problem. Hopefully I can harness the past year of experience into shorter idea-to-implementation spans, and thus a more varied amount of work. But I’m not going to stress over the situation. It’s a great bind to be in, I think. Onward and upward!</p>
