      <h1>
        Announcing Hai to the Ku: Twitter, Haiku and You
      </h1>





<p>As I was exploring <a href="http://twitter.com/scrawlers">Twitter</a> outreach for my project, <a href="http://scrawlers.com/">Scrawlers</a>, I learned there is a significant population of folks writing haiku on Twitter. It makes sense; haiku is about the only legitimate art form that fits properly into a tweet. Six word stories are a fun diversion, but I grow tired of them rather quickly.</p>

<p>Haiku is not only about content, but also meter. As with any form of poetry, haiku begs to be read out loud and appreciated beyond a prosaic level. Haiku at its best is a short verse of music.</p>

<p>The usefulness of Twitter may be argued at length. It seems to me the ability to <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23haiku">quickly publish and share haiku</a> with anyone who wants to see it is pretty utilitarian. The presentational aspect of haiku on Twitter leaves a lot to be desired. This is where <a href="http://haitotheku.com/">Hai to the Ku</a> enters the picture.</p>

<p><a href="http://haitotheku.com/"><img alt="Twitter, haiku and you: Hai to the Ku" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1560" height="387" src="../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/haitotheku.jpg" title="Twitter, haiku and you: Hai to the Ku" width="750"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://haitotheku.com/">Hai to the Ku</a> grabs a large pile of the latest tweets tagged with “#haiku” and presents them to you in a slowly descending stream. Take a break from the daily grind to read melodic writings of the Twitter poets in residence.</p>

<p>Add your own voice to the stream. <a href="http://k12east.mrdonn.org/Haiku.html">Haiku rules</a> are a 3-line verse with 5-7-5 syllables. Haiku typically expresses feeling or mood and does not rhyme. Simply tweet <strong><nobr>"5 / 7 / 5 #haiku"</nobr></strong> and look for your poem in the stream.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing your writing at Hai to the Ku.</p>
