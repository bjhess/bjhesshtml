      <h1>
        Five Years Old
      </h1>





<p>This blog turns five today. Over the past year the blog has been relatively quiet, though I’ve put in a lot of time on a <a href="../2009/07/28/leaving-the-corporate-nest-fin/index.html">specific series of posts</a>. I’m a little disheartened to see that the most frequently visited blog posts for the past year were all written in 2008 or 2007.</p>

<p>It appears most traffic to this little blog is through Google searches about specific programming problems. Other topics I write on are just not compelling enough to be passed around like a virus. That’s OK.</p>

  Do not let what you consume define you.<br>
  Rather, let what you create speak to your worth.

<p>For the past few weeks I’ve been in a creative funk. Whenever I actively try to avoid working too much, it leads to over consumption of media. Not inspiring media like great books, great movies, or great photographs. I get stuck churning on RSS feeds I tried to bury long ago and checking Twitter and email. I’ve even picked up an addictive Scrabble game on my iPhone to while away the hours.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, my creative outlets are my code and this blog. My code has led to some pretty fun projects, and a pretty fulfilling career. This blog has resulted in some nice compliments and introspective writing is not a waste even if it is not shared. It’s not a shame to keep investing time in code and this blog.</p>

<p>I’m not a workaholic. I don’t fear I’ll overreact to this funk by working all hours of the day. An alternative is to recognize other creative opportunities. There’s a kick-ass little camera sitting on my desk. There are some amazing slide photos from the 50‘s sitting on this computer, waiting to be cleaned up and shared. There is a nice kitchen in my home, and I enjoy cooking.</p>

<p>Spending most of the day creating sounds very tiring on its surface. But I <em>know</em> staying up until midnight diddling on an iPhone is tiring. Perhaps hitting the bed weary from activity and falling asleep quickly will be less taxing than nights of deafening insomnia. It’s worth a try.</p>
