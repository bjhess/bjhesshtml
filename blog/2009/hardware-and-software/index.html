        Hardware and Software
      </h1>





      <p>John Nunemaker at RailsTips recently <a href="http://railstips.org/2009/1/5/my-setup-and-software">asked the
          Tubes</a> what hardware and software was being used to complete work. Here’s my rundown.</p>

      <h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

      <p><img alt="My workspace" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3511/3178821060_a1d0e272de.jpg"></p>

      <p><br></p>

      <p>(<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bjhess/3178821060/"

      <p>My deck is a MacBook 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo with 4GB RAM. I’ve been using an Apple Wireless keyboard for a while. I
        loved typing on my Microsoft Ergo 4000 board, but it’s <em>so damn wide</em>. My shoulder thanks me for the
        Wireless even while my wrists are slapping me.</p>

      <p>I also have an auxiliary computer, a Mac Mini. It serves a slave purpose most of they day, playing music from
        iTunes and providing API docs on the second monitor. It has <a
          href="../2008/01/18/superduper-is-my-savior/index.html">saved my bacon</a> as an emergency work machine in the
        past. Behind the BenQ 24“ monitor sits a 250GB Western Digital Passport drive for backup. More about that later.
      </p>

      <p>Shure E2c headphones provide complete aural privacy when needed. However I have grown tired of these as in-ear
        headphones bother me rather quickly. Even though the Shures provide about 9 different pieces of in-ear hardware,
        none of them quite work for me. I’ll probably move on to an <a
          href="http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-280-Pro-Professional/dp/B000065BPB">over-ear solution</a> soon.</p>

      <h3 id="software">Software</h3>

      <p>Let me get the basics out of the way. <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, <a
          href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> for speed,
        <a href="http://getfirefox.com">FireFox</a> for developing, <a href="http://skitch.com/">Skitch</a>, CocoaMySQL
        (which has apparently disappeared), and <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>.</p>

      <p>Time tracking is <a href="http://getharvest.com">Harvest</a> country. Actually, I interact with my time almost
        exclusively through <a href="http://coopapp.com">Co-op</a>‘s integration with Harvest. I do visit Harvest for
        reporting and such.</p>

      <p>For email, I pretty much use <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> with <a
          href="http://mailplaneapp.com/">Mailplane</a> exclusively.</p>

      <p>I don’t have a lot of calendaring needs, so I mostly use <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/">Google
          Calendar</a> (watch out, still in beta). At some point I set up an unholy sync to iCal so I get PING reminders
        every so often. But honestly, I don’t trust the sync at all. If I ever have greater need for strict calendaring
        I’ll get it all figured out. (My personal email is also <em>sort of</em> on Gmail, though I don’t have Apps for
        [My] Domain set up or anything. Just an auto-forward.)</p>

      <p>I work on a completely distributed team, yet I hardly never use the phone, audio chat, or video chat. On
        occasion I’ll use Google Chat to have a quick conversation with <a href="http://iridesco.com">my team</a>. For
        the most part, <a href="http://coopapp.com">Co-op</a> and email keep us connected. Oh, and we’re using an
        internal app to deal with our tickets and plans. Not sure if I’d call it a project management app, though.
        Project management is a bit too highfalutin for us. :)</p>

      <p>I’m pretty sure <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> is my thing for personal task management.
        Will have to decide within a few days.</p>

      <p>Big point. Get a backup system. A bootable backup is preferred if you depend on working hours to make money
        (i.e. you’re not salaried). I have partitioned my Western Digital 250GB Passport such that it can hold to entire
        bootable mirrors of my MacBook. I then use <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper">SuperDuper!</a> on a
        schedule to create a mirror on alternating partitions each day (except Sunday). In the end, this gives me two
        days worth of bootable partitions at any one time. I have used this to work for a week on my Mac Mini (booted
        from the Western Digital drive as if my MacBook) while my MacBook was in the shop. Saved my bacon, I say!</p>

      <p>Wait, now that isn’t so much a backup system as a recovery system. I also send all of my important files, as
        well as every family photo, nightly to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon S3</a> via <a
          href="http://www.jungledisk.com/">Jungle Disk</a>. I can’t recommend it enough.</p>

      <p>Some other apps I find myself using throughout the day: <a
          href="http://www.freemacware.com/rapidowrite">RapidoWrite</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>,
        Twitterific on the iPhone, <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> (for personal feeds), <a
          href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> (for app instances of Twitter, Google Reader and Co-op), <a
          href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a> (for work feeds), <a
          href="http://growl.info/">growl</a>, <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">jing</a> (for quick videos to share
        with the team), <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> (for quick photo shares), <a
          href="http://smugmug.com">SmugMug</a> (to share photos with my family), <a
          href="http://dontbreakthechain.com">Don’t Break the Chain</a> (to keep me exercising, reading, writing, and
        sleeping), <a href="http://www.hamrick.com/">VueScan</a>, <a
          href="http://www.malcom-mac.com/blog/pdfmergex/">PDFMergeX</a> (for reassembling scanned documents), <a
          href="http://www.objectpark.org/FuzzyClock.html">FuzzyClock</a> (who needs to know the exact time?), <a
          href="http://spiritedaway.drikin.com/">SpiritedAway</a> (auto-hide unused apps), <a
          href="http://marketcircle.com/iphoney/">iPhoney</a>, <a href="http://www.neooffice.org">NeoOffice</a>, <a
          href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">Fusion</a>,
        <a href="http://github.com">github</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.github.com/pieter/gitx">gitx</a>. When I need
        to take a note, I do it in text files which I can search with Spotlight. To ease the sorting pain, I use <a
          href="../2007/05/02/taking-notes-and-checking-them-twice/index.html">some Automator scripts</a>.</p>

      <p>Hopefully this quick rundown has given you some ideas for things you can improve in your work environment. Keep
        in mind, home office workers, watch out for <a
          href="http://watercooler.iridesco.com/post/69153826/home-office-no-bling">bling creep</a>. If you have an idea
        where I can improve, please do share!</p>
