      <h1>
        Leaving the Corporate Nest (Fin)
      </h1>





      <p>Nearly 11 months ago I <a href="../2008/09/10/leaving-the-corporate-nest/index.html">began</a> a blog series
        meant to document all of the mental roadblocks that long stood in the way of my career fulfillment. Last week I
        finally put the series to rest with a post about the <a
          href="../2009/07/23/security-of-dreams/index.html">negative and positive roles of dreams</a>.</p>

      <p>It was a great experience writing these posts. Forcing myself to consider all of the reasons I might have
        stayed in the corporate fold gave me even more confidence in the path I have taken. It has also been fun
        discussing these topics with friends and colleagues. The many friendly disagreements were the most eye-opening
        of all!</p>

      <p>Special thanks to Luke Ibis, <a href="http://www.nathanmelcher.com/">Nathan Melcher</a>, and Todd Rud. They
        each read my articles, gave great advice on form and editing, helped me to focus the message, and disagreed with
        me many times over. I appreciate all they have done to support me.</p>

      <p>I just reread each of the posts again before writing this. I hope you can find some value in giving them one
        more read as well.</p>
