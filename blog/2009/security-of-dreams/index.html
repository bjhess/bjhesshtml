      <p>As a child I carried with me a host of dreams. My dreams ranged from the fantastical to the remotely possible.
        While I was quite pleased with my childhood, these dreams kept me at least intrigued that the future could
        somehow be even better. Early on I realized human teleportation was not something I would likely see. But
        perhaps with a successful career I could become rich enough to build the mazed tree house I seemed to see every
        time I closed my eyes.</p>

      <p>These childhood dreams were never goals to be reached. Yet they did contribute to the hopefulness that makes me
        human. Everyone needs a measure of hope for the future in order to maintain sanity in the slightly-less-amazing
        present. It is a necessary aspect of being human to convince oneself that even though now is pretty good, or
        perhaps very bad, there is a point in the future where life will be better.</p>

      <p>Dreams are an excellent container for hope. Even as an adult, one can maintain a set of theoretically possible,
        but rather unlikely dreams. For some, these dreams drive them to greater and greater success throughout their
        careers, whether or not they reach the ultimate goal of the vision. For the vast majority of us, these dreams
        are used to forgo ever starting down that road toward the infeasible goal. Our adult minds convince us that the
        ultimate dream is unattainable and keep us from ever analyzing whether the stops along the road are in
        themselves destinations that are preferable to our current location.</p>

      <p>My eyes were opening a few years ago, as I realized not only was my list of attainable goals blank, but my
        cache of dreams sat empty. Shortly after this recognition, the “dream bag” was filled with multiplicities of
        <strong>
          <nobr>Idea &gt; ??? &gt; Profit</nobr>
        </strong>. I started talking to other colleagues and their store of career fantasies began growing. Soon these
        colleagues and I thought a lot about dreams while doing very little to make them a reality. We talked about the
        <strong>Idea</strong> and the <strong>Profit</strong>, but never did anything about the <strong>???</strong>. We
        had a shared dream and we were stuck in it.</p>

      <p>Our group eventually chose to release itself from the dream’s grip. The dream never left us, but our rational
        adult minds told us the dream was a delusion; we’d have to give up too much to make it even possible. The dream
        continued to provide hope, but created no positive change.</p>

      <p>This path was not for me. Instead of using the extreme nature of a dream to dismiss the journey to the dream, I
        began investigating some of the stops along the road. I realized that these practical stopping points, and
        indeed the journey itself, was greatly preferable to the space I already occupied.</p>

      <p>I still fantasize about a future with unbridled travel and labyrinths in the backyard woods. These dreams do
        not numb me to the wonderful futures I can conjure and achieve. Let dreams enhance your journey through life.
      </p>
