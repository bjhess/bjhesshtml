<p>“Maximizing Developer Value” was the unfortunate subtitle of <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/events/Code-Freeze-2009">Code Freeze 2009</a>, held yesterday at the University of Minnesota. The most interesting theme was more approachable: brain hacking. Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your left brain is loud and obnoxious. It’s always chatting.</li>

<li>Your right brain has things to say, and considering it’s the creative lobe, it benefits you to find a way to listen.</li>

<li>Mindless sequential tasks (shower, toys/puzzles, lawn mowing) can distract your left brain, allowing your right brain to speak to you.</li>

<li>You may find success assigning yourself right brain tasks before entering the shower or falling asleep.</li>

<li>Right brain thoughts are fleeting – have a way to capture these thoughts as immediately as possible.</li>

<li>Music occupies your right brain, so prune your “creativity” playlist appropriately. Music may be a hurdle you never knew you were putting in front of your creativity. Often <a href="http://simplynoise.com/">noise</a> is the best solution to block out the aural distractions.</li>

<li>Verbalization, even to inanimate objects, often engages the brain in different and useful ways. Sufficient sleep and moderate exercise are easily the best ways to maximize your brain’s efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kicking off a new year makes it easy for me to live in “try new things” territory. I took a shower without NPR playing on the shower radio and suddenly I came up with the perfect idea for my first RUM presentation. I may also make lawn mowing a podcast-free zone, assuming summer/global warming ever returns. Music will be an ambiance for email checking. And I may have to invest in a sock monkey to talk to since I’m 1200 miles from the nearest work conversation.</p>
