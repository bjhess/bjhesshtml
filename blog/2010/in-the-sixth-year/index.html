      <h1>
        In the Sixth Year
      </h1>





<p>Here I am, six years of blogging - on and off blogging. I took a look at the traffic report for this blog’s past year. The top 20 most popular posts are from 2007 and earlier. Perhaps I should consider giving this whole blogging thing up?</p>

<p>Probably not. I still occasionally run into something that I can post in hopes of helping out another person with a similar problem. I do have a list of post ideas somewhere, and maybe I’ll get to them one day. So please bear with me. Keep me in your RSS reader and maybe one day you’ll find something of interest.</p>

<p>Thanks for sticking with me so far. Perhaps we’ll meet again here in the blogiverse.</p>
