      <h1>
        Books Read 2010
      </h1>





<p>It’s that time again: Books read 2010. I love <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/snackeru/greet/2010/12/25/books_read_2010.php">Shane’s annual reading list</a>, and here is my significantly shorter version. As always, connect with me on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1861433">Goodreads</a>.</p>

<p>I’m surprised to see that I read the exact same number of books in 2010 as in <a href="../2009/12/31/books_read_2009/index.html">2009</a>. My goal is to read more in 2011 than the past few years, which might be a silly goal with child number three just about here. I have vowed to do more book reading and less online reading in 2011, so maybe in the end it will just even out.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man’s War Books 1-4 by John Scalzi</strong></p>

<p>The quality of the books definitely descend as the series goes along, and #4 was a painful cash grab. But I can’t complain - most of the reading was quite good. Book one, Old Man’s War is rather outstanding. The books have a very conversational feel while still remaining smart sci-fi.</p>

<p><strong>Rework by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson</strong></p>

<p>Great for anyone who has never been exposed to the beliefs of 37signals. Mostly a rehash for me, but still worth having on hand. If you aren’t familiar with 37signals, definitely give this a read. Though it might make you want to quit your job.</p>

<p><strong>Crush It! by Gary Vaynerchuk</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve never heard this guy talk about business and going places in life, it’s worth your time. Seek some videos out on the ‘net while you’re at it. This book does a decent job of translating his over-the-top personality into words.</p>

<p><strong>In the Ballpark by George Gmelch</strong></p>

<p>A bit dated, but certainly an interesting look at all kinds of folks who work in a ballpark and their varying back stories. For 99% of folks working in baseball passion and love of the game is required because great riches are not part of the equation.</p>

<p><strong>The Joy of Keeping Score by Paul Dicks</strong></p>

<p>A quick read and somewhat interesting for some of the stories and nuances about scorekeeping.</p>

<p><strong>Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt</strong></p>

<p>I must admit I only read half of this book before I had to return it to the library (a “rental” from afar). This is a classic of the genre, and indeed the economic discussion within was very simplified and readable for little ol’ me. It’s clearly a libertarian angle on things, but worthwhile regardless of your leanings.</p>

<p><strong>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom by Cory Doctorow</strong></p>

<p>A fast, and fairly interesting read. Some slightly veiled ideas about agile methodologies and corporate management set within an odd story of a future where the Magic Kingdom is one of the most prestigious places on earth. While not a monster of the genre, I will give Doctorow another chance.</p>

<p><strong>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by Frank Baum</strong></p>

<p>Read this to my duaghters. I can’t believe I had never read The Wizard of Oz. It was interesting, but I’m not incredibly motivated to read the sequels.</p>

<p><strong>Do More Faster by Brad Feld and David Cohen</strong></p>

<p>This book was a bit too startupy for me. Of course, I knew that going in. A few nice takeaways, though. Mostly the idea of taking a week “off the grid” every year as well as other tips to stay sane with desk work. I’ll be talking more later about taking a week off the grid on this blog soon.</p>

<p><strong>Last Chance to See by Mark Carwardine</strong></p>

<p>A beautiful picture book (also with tons of words) following up on the original Last Chance to See. Don’t get the eBook or borrow from the library - buy this one. Probably from the U.K. as I can’t find it in the states.</p>
