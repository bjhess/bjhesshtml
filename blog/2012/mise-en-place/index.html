        Mise en Place
      </h1>





<p>Previously I compared cooking with software development. Time to stretch that analogy <a href="../craftsmen/index.html">further</a> with more discussion of “Kitchen Confidential.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mise en place is the religion of all good line cooks. Do <em>not</em> fuck with a line cook’s “meez” – meaning their set-up, their carefully arranged supplies of sea salt, rough-cracked pepper, softened butter, cooking oil, wine, back-ups and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The difference between a line cook on her feet for four straight hours serving 100‘s of meals in tight sychronicity and a programmer jotting off 100’s of lines of code at her desk is pretty stark. Each is a craft, however. Organization is a factor in the success of a craftsman. Not some sort of organization edict, but a unique understanding of how <em>she</em> works. Organization is not only where the tools are, but what they are and how they are configured.</p>

<p>A great developer will not take kindly to forced diversions from her preferred toolset. A great developer loves to see how others work. A great developer devours new techniques, increasing her kinetic energy in relation to mere mortals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Working clean, constantly wiping and cleaning, is a desireable state of affairs for the conscientious line cook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Organization means different things to different people. My idea of clean may be stomach turning to you. I am convinced those who embrace disruptive open office settings and constant Twitter pings on their computer are not being honest with themselves. Experimentation with a calmer, cleaner environment would lead to greater success in most cases.</p>

<p>One who has put her tools in place is likely of an organized and focused mind. She knows her tools, all within her reach. Right as they are needed.</p>

<p>Do <em>not</em> fuck with her meez.</p>
