      <h1>
        Quick Alert
      </h1>

      
    


<p>I frequently have the need jot off a reminder to myself. Pick up The Kid from school in two hours. Don’t forget to drop tax paperwork off at lunch. My desire was for a natural-language way to create these alerts quickly without interrupting my workflow.</p>

<p><em>You’re thinking “just make an event on your phone.” That is interruptive and slow. You say “don’t you have Siri?!” No, and where’d I set my phone again?</em></p>

<p>My first thought was to build a Ruby gem that allowed me to type into my console and schedule a text message to my phone. Alternatively it would schedule emails and even phone calls. I built the basics of the gem. Syntax:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; alert remember lunch in 30 days</code></pre>

<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/chronic">chronic</a> and a few tricks, that worked. Ah, but I needed a web service to receive the reminder, schedule it, and intermittently run jobs to notify me. I could share this with the world! And the world could share its requests, not to mention its downtime, with me!</p>

<p>Then I remembered iCloud exists. I dug around for a short time trying to figure out how to get my library to talk to iCal. That was frustrating. That’s when I found <a href="http://flexibits.com/">Fantastical</a> and for $20 my workflow is now:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an “alerts” calendar in iCal</li>

<li>Make sure your calendar is syncing to your phone</li>

<li>Set Fantastical to default to “alerts” calendar</li>

<li>Set Fantastical to default alert “Message with Sound” 0 minutes before event</li>

<li>Hit ctrl-option-space and type “remember lunch in 30 minutes”</li>
</ol>

<p>Much better. Fantastical’s exceptional natural language processing takes over, iCloud gets the alert to my phone, and I’m back to work.</p>
