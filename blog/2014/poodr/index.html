<p>I was skeptical that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a> would be anything but a refresher. Thirteen years writing software, most of it object oriented, suggested my experience would make it all review. Especially since the necessary “trivial” examples of a book cannot compare to real world.</p>

<p>Surprisingly POODR stands in both worlds, presenting relatively simple problems while remaining imminently practical. It has challenged my beliefs about how unentangled a production application is capable of being. I will be pushing myself to stay true to the concepts in upcoming implementations.</p>
