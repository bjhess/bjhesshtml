      <h1>
        So Now You're Working From Home
      </h1>

      <p>Right now a lot of people are being thrust into the experience of working from home. Some may revel in it, some
        are
        dreading it, and some who now revel in it will come to dread it. This is a grand experiment and each person will
        have
        different outcomes.</p>

      <p>As someone who has spent the past 13 years working from home, hopefully I can provide you some tips and
        pointers to
        help make this transition as painless as it can be. I certainly haven’t thought of everything here, so please
        get in
        touch if you have questions!</p>

      <h3 id="keep_your_routines_except_when_you_shouldnt">Keep your routines (except when you shouldn’t)</h3>

      <p>Working from home isn’t some sort of alternate reality. It’s just working, but from a different location.
        Keeping
        routines will help you keep work in its place.</p>

      <h4 id="typical_mornings">Typical mornings</h4>

      <p>If your normal preparation for work involves waking up after one alarm snooze, exercising, showering, getting
        dressed, and then eating breakfast, your best bet is to keep doing that. This has an effect on your mental
        state,
        putting you in the typical work mindset.</p>

      <p>Big caveat here is that if you have children your normal routine is most likely even more disrupted. In this
        case it
        is important to keep the routines that you can control in place. Another caveat is that the routine of a commute
        is
        also no longer in your world. This may allow you to adjust the times on your schedule to, say, get more sleep.
        Please
        get more sleep. You need the energy reserves right now. More on the power that commutes have to mentally
        delineate
        your day later.</p>

      <h4 id="shower">Shower</h4>

      <p>Please. For the sake of your family. If you shower at night, shower at night. If you shower in the morning,
        shower in
        the morning. Shower.</p>

      <h4 id="dress_the_part">Dress the part</h4>

      <p>I recommend you dress at least to the level you would dress when going out to do shopping on the weekend. (My
        assumption is that your shopping atire isn’t pajamas or ratty tee shirts from school.) Some may find it best to
        wear
        the same things they would typically wear to work in the office. Hopefully this helps your brain get in a
        focused work
        mindset.</p>

      <p>Don’t follow my kids’ advice here. Kid 1, “Hey, why don’t you put some actual clothes on today?” Kid 2,
        “Clothes were
        so last week.”</p>

      <p>By all means when you’re done working remove your pants if that is your routine.</p>

      <p><img src="images/murray.gif" alt="Murray Goldberg" /></p>

      <h4 id="eat_well">Eat well</h4>

      <p>In as much as it is possible in these times, eat well. In this case, your routine is not necessarily the thing
        to
        stick to. Your family needs you healthy right now. <em>All of us</em> need you healthy right now. If you had
        always
        been meaning to up your bean intake, well, now is the time! By the time you’re back in the office your body will
        probably have adjusted and you won’t be nearly as gassy. Use this time to make that change you’ve kept putting
        on the
        back burner. (I mean, don’t go overboard. I wouldn’t go from zero to 2-day-fast out of the gate.)</p>

      <h4 id="exercise">Exercise</h4>

      <p>Much like the above, if at all possible it is important to <em>at least</em> replace the movement activity you
        would
        have done by nature of commuting and being at work. And if you already had an exercise routine, keep to it as
        much as
        you can with aerobic movement, body weight, and home equipment. It would be great right now to add in things
        like
        stretching, <a href="https://www.tinyhabits.com/good-spot">push ups</a>, light yoga, etc.</p>

      <h4 id="meditate">Meditate</h4>

      <p>Do you meditate or pray each day? Continue doing that.</p>

      <h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

      <p>It may seem that working from home finally gives you the ability to shut down over-communication like you’ve
        always
        wanted to. You imagine the wasteful meetings being minimized and a bunch of time opening up to get the work
        done.</p>

      <p>First of all, this <em>is</em> an opportunity to <a
          href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/estimate-the-cost-of-a-meeting-with-this-calculator">reduce meetings</a>.
        Contrary to
        popular belief, however, communication as a general topic has to get <em>better</em> in a work-from-home
        environment.
        This especially goes for written communication. There is already a costly friction to half-considered thoughts
        being
        spewed around in traditional work environments. That cost probably gets orders of magnitude higher in a remote
        environment.</p>

      <p>Writing clearly, yet succinctly, is a skill that requires practice. We all can get better and now is the time
        to
        really get practicing.</p>

      <p>It is natural to think that group chat is the way to solve this problem. Group chat has its place on a remote
        team,
        but there are <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems">a lot of dangers</a> – especially with
        the
        collective raised anxiety we are all feeling today. That being said, it is important to stay connected with your
        friends and colleagues during the workday. It is important to have some fun throughout the day as well, and
        real-time
        chat is a good place to do that.</p>

      <p>Making use of the repositories of knowledge for your various projects is golden at times like this. Hopefully
        those
        repositories are organized and not buried in an email thread. Be thoughtful and considered with when and how you
        post
        things, but don’t hold helpful knowledge back. Writing in this depth requires vulnerability, which is one more
        thing
        we’ll all be practicing in these times.</p>

      <p>Here are <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate">a bunch more thoughts and tips</a> from
        Basecamp, a
        remote team who likely has over 100 years of collective experience. (I’m not +1‘ing all of their tools and
        methods,
        but there is a lot of collective knowledge in there.)</p>

      <h3 id="finding_a_rhythm">Finding a rhythm</h3>

      <p>You are going to have to find a way to get consecutive hours of focus each day in order to accomplish the work
        you
        need to do.</p>

      <h4 id="avoid_distractions">Avoid distractions</h4>

      <p>In the past I would definitely say if you are fortunate enough to be working in a room with a door, that door
        should
        be shut. However, in recent years I’ve learned that we sort of lightly poison ourselves with our own CO2 when we
        shut
        ourselves in a room for extended periods. I have taken measurements in my home office and CO2 counts rise
        throughout
        the day to points that will impact your alertness and cognition. Open windows and doors aren’t necessary at all
        times,
        but should probably be part of your daily rituals when working from home.</p>

      <p>If there are other people in your home, headphones and discussing the rules are going to be your best bet. Let
        your
        family know that when the headphones are on you are working and need to concentrate uninterrupted. Of course as
        we say
        in our house, “If there is a fire or someone broke their arm, please interrupt.” Over time even smaller children
        will
        start to learn the rules.</p>

      <h4 id="music">Music</h4>

      <p>I am a firm believer that you are not going to get into a focused state listening to music with words in your
        native
        language. One exception is if you are so familiar with the songs that your mind doesn’t get distracted by the
        lyrics.
        I prefer instrumental jazz, ambient/electronic, classical, or foreign language music. Here’s a <a
          href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3UpmsJWJrjSSZflRy5DboH?si=Lvi1hpPwSIuZc5FXxy0bhA">Spotify playlist</a>
        of
        mostly ambient/electronic, but be aware that it breaks my own rules at times.</p>

      <p>You can guess that I don’t have positive experience with being productive while listening to audiobooks,
        podcasts, TV
        shows, or movies. Though I have definitely worked with folks who run daytime TV all day and were also mega
        productive.
      </p>

      <p>In the end it’s going to be up to your own self evaluation. Find your own right thing.</p>

      <h4 id="switch_it_up">Switch it up</h4>

      <p>This is a little harder when we find ourselves asked to isolate in our homes. Typically I would recommend the
        occasional jaunt to the coffee shop for a change of scenery. This always had a huge effect on my productivity.
        Unfortunately the coffee shop isn’t a smart option for us in this moment. We can simulate changing our locations
        in
        and around our homes. Unplug your laptop from your monitor and go sit on the couch (with headphones). When the
        weather
        warms up, sit out on your patio for a bit. (Combating sun glare is a whole different challenge. 🙂) Put together
        a
        makeshift standing desk.</p>

      <p>You can switch up other things like your music, your tidiness of your physical and virtual desktop, your fidget
        toys,
        your desktop backgrounds, etc. Keep things fresh and change things up every week.</p>

      <h4 id="take_breaks">Take breaks</h4>

      <p>In the past I’ve had very good luck using the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro
          Technique</a>. The basic idea:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Set a timer for 25 minutes (this is a “pomodoro”)</li>

        <li>Work on your task(s)</li>

        <li>When the timer finishes, take a 5-minute break</li>

        <li>Then start another pomodoro</li>

        <li>After 4 pomodoros take a longer break – say 20 minutes</li>
      </ol>

      <p><img src="images/kimmy.gif" alt="Kimmy" /></p>

      <p>I think this or some modified version of it can work very well. Maybe a Swimming Pool Technique where you work
        50
        minutes and then take 10 minute break would be better for you? Experiment!</p>

      <p>What do you do on your breaks? (Incidentally, you should set a timer for your breaks as well! Being able to
        quickly
        set timers and alerts is quite a valuable thing for the remote worker.)</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Chat with your family</li>

        <li><a
            href="http://www.storytrender.com/425/watch-father-two-stays-toned-ultimate-dad-workout-using-kids-weights/">Exercise
            with your family</a></li>

        <li>Grab a healthy snack</li>

        <li>Make a coffee or tea</li>

        <li>Stretch and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT_dFRnmdGs">work on your posture</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>When I read, “I can’t work from home because I’ll be too tempted to do the laundry and the thing and the other
        thing.” This is where you <em>intentionally</em> put these things. Switch the laundry and get back to work, etc.
        Be
        disciplined.</p>

      <p>Save bigger distractions (watching a movie, playing a video game, etc) for lunch breaks. Reward yourself with
        these
        things as they aren’t things you can typically do in an office. Heck, maybe try a lunchtime <a
          href="https://www.netflixparty.com">Netflix Party</a> with friends!</p>

      <h3 id="starting_the_day">Starting the day</h3>

      <p>As I mentioned above, keeping routines is important. Everyone has a morning ritual, but without the commute to
        work
        you may find it difficult to get mentally switched on to work. In this time you will probably need to simulate
        your
        commute. Maybe it is walking and feeding the dog. Maybe it is walking and feeding the kids. Maybe it is just
        walking
        yourself. It will take intention, but try to find some activity or totem that helps you kick off your work day.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ending_the_day">Ending the day</h3>

      <p>A lot of folks struggle transitioning to remote work because they have trouble leaving work at work. This was a
        bit
        easier when they had a commute. Whether the commute was 5 or 50 minutes, it was an obvious transition from work
        to the
        rest of their day. The brain would allow them to release their work problems and focus on the more important
        parts of
        life.</p>

      <p>As a remote worker, leaving work directly for the dinner table is something I have done way more often than I
        should.
        It is an all too familiar feeling, sitting at the dinner table basically not listening to any of the
        conversations
        going on around me. My mind is still churning on that problem I was trying to solve. More likely than me
        listening to
        how my child’s day went was me rudely interrupting them to talk about my work challenges. That’s no good!</p>

      <p>Here are a few things I’ve seen people use to put the finishing touches on their workdays and make the
        transition:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Document where you’re at in your work. Write down what you’ve learned and where you need to pick up
          tomorrow. This
          will make it easier for your brain to allow you to set the problem aside for tomorrow. It is also practicing
          your
          written communication. Bonus!</li>

        <li>Finish the workday by planning tomorrow. Write down the top 3 things that you want to accomplish at work
          tomorrow.
        </li>

        <li>Have a happy hour video call with friends.</li>

        <li>Mentally commute:
          <ul>
            <li>Go for a walk or insert other exercise routine</li>

            <li>Fire up that turntable you swore you were going to use and listen to one side of a record (or just rock
              out to
              your favorite album on streaming)</li>

            <li>Write in your journal</li>

            <li>Meditate or pray</li>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect">Play tetris</a></li>

            <li>Take a shower</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="weekends">Weekends</h3>

      <p>Sometimes projects require weekend work. I hope in your world this is the exception and not the rule. It is
        tempting
        to do a little work when we see our new home office set up over there in the corner. Many are fortunate to enjoy
        solving work problems. Certainly work can serve as a distraction from the stresses coming at us from both inside
        and
        outside of our homes.</p>

      <p>It will take some intention to avoid working on the weekends. I suggest spending a bit of time on Friday
        afternoon to
        make your weekend plans. Maybe it’s a James Bond movie marathon. Maybe it’s baking banana bread for your
        neighbors.
        Maybe it’s <a href="https://www.deaconess.com/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask">sewing face masks</a>. Maybe it’s getting
        to
        those household projects you’ve been putting off.</p>

      <p>A lot of folks get a majority of their social time at work. It’s important in this time to continue getting
        virtual
        social time on the weekends. Plan video calls with family and friends, have extended family meals in a video
        call, or
        have a <a href="https://www.netflixparty.com">Netflix Party</a>. Walk around your neighborhood and have
        socially-distant conversations with your neighbors using your outdoor voice.</p>

      <p>This is probably a good time to set a goal for yourself. Always wanted to be able to do 10 pull ups? 25 push
        ups?
        Play guitar? Run an 8-minute mile? Become conversational in another language? Go for it!</p>

      <p><img src="images/janet.gif" alt="Janet" /></p>

      <h3 id="yeah_but_what_about_child_care_and_schooling">Yeah, but what about child care and schooling?</h3>

      <p>Working from home while having to care for (and possibly teach) children that typically are not home on
        weekdays is
        an entirely different challenge. Unfortunately I do not have much advice to offer on that subject. If you have a
        partner in the house, you will have to take shifts. If not, it will be even more challenging. There is no shame
        in
        putting a movie on throughout the day to reward the kids’ focus on homeworking during other parts of the day.
        And I
        hope employers give everyone grace and understanding in this time. People over deadlines.</p>

      <h3 id="its_simple_not_easy">It’s simple, not easy</h3>

      <p>So that’s it. Basically you need to practice intentionality, discipline, and responsibility. Simple enough.
        It’s not
        natural for any of us, though. It will take time to become comfortable with working from home. It will test your
        reserves of forgiveness for yourself and for others. Over time, though, it can get more comfortable. While you
        might
        always prefer working in an office setting in the end, you can still figure out how to be happy and productive
        working
        from home.</p>

      <p>Good luck and be well!</p>
