      <h1>
        Dark mode colors with CSS variables
      </h1>

      <p>I have been working on simplifying the design of my site. I wanted a design that was easy to maintain, adjusts
        to the
        screen on which you are reading, and was very readable across screen <a
          href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18270975/how-to-dark-mode-iphone-android-mac-windows-xbox-ps4-nintendo-switch">lighting
          modes</a>. When I started looking for ways to simply change CSS depending on whether the reader was viewing in
        a
        light or dark mode on their device, I was surprised to find search result after search result offering solutions
        using
        CSS classes swapped in and out with JavaScript. This didn’t feel like a problem that needed to be solved with
        JavaScript!</p>

      <p>I started playing around with <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties</a>.
        In
        the simplest terms, these work as variables that can be defined in one place and changed in one place, but
        referenced
        throughout your CSS files. Seems like a great option to adjust the value of background colors when dark mode is
        detected!</p>

      <p>To detect dark mode I needed the media query <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme"><code>prefers-color-scheme</code></a>.
        This sort of thing can be placed at the top of a CSS file (or in a separate file that you <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import"><code>@import</code></a>) and the variables
        can be
        freely used throughout the rest of your CSS code:</p>

      <code>
        <pre><span class="symbol">:root</span> <span class="punct">{</span>
  <span class="punct">--</span><span class="ident">main</span><span class="punct">-</span><span class="ident">bg</span><span class="punct">-</span><span class="ident">color</span><span class="punct">:</span> <span class="comment">#96BFE6;  /* Salvia Blue */</span>

<span class="punct">}</span>
</pre></code>

      <p>As more varying design colors are brought into the design and used multiple times throughout the rest of the
        CSS,
        centralizing the color elements in one spot will be very helpful for colorizing in both light and dark modes. I
        hope
        this helps someone out there!</p>

      <p>Note: I assume all the examples I found use JavaScript because there probably is some worry about browser
        compatibility for <a
          href="https://caniuse.com/?search=prefers-color-scheme"><code>prefers-color-scheme</code></a>. In
        my case I’m not concerned about seeing the same behavior in browsers that are not recognizing this useful media
        query.
        I guess their screens will remain bright in the dark!</p>
