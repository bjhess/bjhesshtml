        Why I Went HTML Only
      </h1>

      <p>I <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="/blog/2022/HTML-only/">rebuilt
          my site with HTML &amp; CSS</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since this winter I have been playing a ton with my personal
        website. The version I was still working with over the winter
        was a blog software based on <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://sinatrarb.com/">Ruby Sinatra</a>. The blog
        had
        been running on it for around twelve years. It had a little
        database, it supported Markdown, and over all it was pretty
        simple. Still, it started seeming too complex for what it needed
        to be.
      </p>

      <p>I spent a couple weeks thinking about changing the site to be
        built with a static site generator like <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>
        or <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.
        It felt like this would be simpler, but as I played around
        with these options I started to feel like things were actually
        getting more complex. After all I was pretty comfortable with
        the little blog software I'd lived with for ten years.
      </p>
      <p>So I abandoned that idea for something else; something I
        hadn't done in fifteen years or so. I started using a
        third-party software. <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> is an application
        I had tried in the past, but it hadn't quite clicked. This
        time I vowed to really dig in, and it turns out I do really
        like the service. There are plenty of templates, which you can
        customize yourself (I did not do that because it seemed too
        complex) and you can also insert your own CSS (which I did do
        to a complex degree). It's sometimes <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="/blog/2022/beginners-mind-microblog/">a bit
          hard to
          follow</a> how you are to do things, but overall I quite
        like it.
      </p>
      <p>One thing I really got interested in is the social side of
        Micro.blog. There is a fun, polite little community behind the
        scenes there. They are easy to talk to and interact with, and
        I grew to enjoy this new type of online social interaction.
        What I didn't love was intermingling my own microposts with my
        longer blog posts. The default landing page was a mix of both.
        I could improve this by providing navigation to longer-form
        posts, but it didn't quite feel right. I could also handle it
        with more in-depth template customization or the use of some
        available plugins, but that seemed challenging. Then I happened uponâ€¦
      </p>

      <p>
        Bradley Taunt's efforts to go back to the basics and <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://tdarb.org/blog/my-static-blog-publishing-setup.html">build
          a static site:</a> HTML and CSS all the way. (He has since
        went even further and built a <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://tdarb.org/posts/shinobi-website.txt">plain
          text
          site</a>.) Seeing this and <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="http://ankarstrom.se/~john/articles/html/">other</a>
        <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">similar</a>
        ideas, I got energized to rebuild things all over again. And so
        I <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="/blog/2022/HTML-only/">rebuilt
          my site with HTML &amp; CSS</a>. It was super fun to build and
        made it easy to add custom sections like <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="/commonplace/">Commonplace</a>, <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="/commonplace/site-history/">Site
          History</a>, and my <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="/now/">now
          page</a>. Since each static page is self-contained, down the
        road I can easily build pages that have wholly different designs
        than the primary site. I'm looking forward to what is possible!
