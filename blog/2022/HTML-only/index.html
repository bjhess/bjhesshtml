      <h1> HTML Only </h1>

      <p>My site is now an HTML &amp; CSS website, just like <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="/commonplace/site-history#2003">the
          old days</a>. I've had a blast rebuilding it in this way.
        The approachability of making updates to the site is off the
        charts, and the speed that it is served by <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
          Pages</a> makes me smile. For some reason it's just more fun
        to make this sort of site in HTML &amp; CSS.
      </p>

      <p>At the moment it is pretty simple to make updates, but there
        is sort of a checklist of things to remember. I'll use this
        post as an example of how I go about adding a new post to the
        site:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a new folder <code>./blog/2022/HTML-only</code></li>
        <li>Create an <code>index.html</code> file in that new folder
          (I do it this way so that the URL will be a nice <code>bjhess.com/blog/2022/HTML-only/</code>)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Copy the HTML code from <code>./blog/template.html</code></li>
        <li>Replace the title and date provided by the template</li>
        <li>Open the new file in the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.seamonkey-project.org">SeaMonkey</a>
          browser</li>
        <li>Click File &gt; Edit Page (âŒ˜E on macOS)</li>
        <li>Write my post and save it</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There! I wrote a post! But more to do:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add a link to the post in <code>./blog/index.html</code></li>
        <li>Add a new entry to <code>./blog/feed.xml</code> and
          refresh the <code>updated</code> date on the feed</li>
        <li>Add the changes to the git repository and push to github</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A few minutes later the post is live and the RSS feed is up
        to date. Not bad!
      </p>

      <p>Is it annoying to have to manually update things like the
        blog index and the RSS feed? Typo-wise, yes, it is easy to
        make a mistake. Time-wise, I haven't found it to be a bother
        as of yet.
      </p>

      <p>While it is a little more time consuming working in code this
        way, it's at least consistent. When I'm working in a software
        like <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>,
        I'm usually writing in Markdown, but sometimes I need to bring
        in HTML code anyway, and it gets confusing. Then if I'm making
        tweaks to the design, I have to go do that in a different
        webform while also maintaining a change history in a separate
        file in git. When I change CSS in blog software it might take
        effect instantly, or it might not. The particular CSS I'm
        changing might work just fine, or it might need an <code>!important</code>
        tacked on to it to work.
      </p>

      <p>I might drop the SeaMonkey editing at some point. It's kind
        of nice to have a WYSIWYG editor for this, but it also adds
        some junk to the HTML at times. Maybe I can learn to not worry
        about that junk.
      </p>

      <p>I might write some scripts to automate things as I go. At
        that point am I just making my own static site generator? I
        don't think so, but maybe. (<a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://github.com/bjhess/bjhesshtml/blob/main/scripts/parse_blog.rb">I
          did some scripting</a> to convert the blog posts from my old
        site, which were dumped to HTML, into static files for the new
        site. I might also do this to convert Intense Debate comments
        over to static comments so those don't get lost down the
        road.)
      </p>

              Not really a comment, more a note registering support about going back to html and css roots.
            </p>

            <p>
              I found my ancient pre-Wordpress site during the Covid lockdown and dusted it down, then wondered about
              the practicality of working that way again. I see your using GitHub to host. Is there any documentation
              you can point me at so I can try similar?
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Barry Hess</strong><br />
                  The <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> website has a lot of documentation, but I
                  find it a bit hard to follow. Let me see if I can explain it accurately by just clicking around the
                  GitHub website. The main thing is you'll have a public repository with HTML, CSS, and other assets
                  within it, kind of like <a href="https://github.com/bjhess/bjhesshtml">this very site</a>. Basically
                  make a public repository with an <code>index.html</code> file in the root directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From there go to the project's <strong>Settings > Pages</strong> area. For a <strong>Source</strong>
                  select your <strong>main</strong> branch and click <strong>Save</strong>.

                </p>

                <p>
                  <a href="images/github-pages.png"><img src="images/github-pages.png"></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you've done that you'll
                  get a message like "Your site is ready to be published at https://githubusername.github.io/reponame/."
                  Your site will be visible at that URL. You will then also have options to setup a custom domain,
                  including links to <a
                    href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">the
                    documentation</a> for that process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hope that helps you get going with static sites on GitHub!
                </p>
