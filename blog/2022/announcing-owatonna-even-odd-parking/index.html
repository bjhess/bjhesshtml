        Announcing Owatonna Even/Odd Parking
      </h1>

      <p>In the town where I live, the middle of November begins what we call “even/odd parking season.” This is a time
        of
        year where, if you are parking on the street, you need to be aware of today’s date, tomorrow’s date, the house
        numbers
        on the street in which you are parking, and the city plowing rules as related to those numbers. Some folks find
        it
        pretty straightforward to do these mental gymnastics, but I just wanted a web page to tell me what to do.</p>

      <p>Enter <a href="https://www.owatonnaparking.com">Owatonna Even/Odd Parking</a>. This page simplifies the winter
        parking rules of my city into a simple statement: Park on the even/odd side of the street. You can load it up at
        the
        website or install it as an app by <a
          href="https://natomasunified.org/kb/add-website-to-mobile-device-home-screen/">adding it to your home
          screen</a>.
        Hope this helps a few of you out there who live near me!</p>
