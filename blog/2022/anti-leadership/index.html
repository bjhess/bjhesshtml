      <h1>
        Anti-Leadership
      </h1>

      <p>When bad things happen, no matter the organization, we look to leaders to step up and help us through to an
        outcome
        that gives us hope for a better future. This starts with helping to solve the immediate problem expediently. As
        the
        wider group is under a high degree of anxiety and panic, a leader’s calm demeanor is helpful. Sometimes they
        need to
        help the team step back, take a breath, and slow down decisions. Other times they need to communicate the
        direness of
        the situation, encouraging quick movement depending on past training and experience.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <a href="#active-harm" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="active-harm-ref">If you’ve got somebody you think
            is actively engaged in harming people or attempting to harm people, your
            obligation as a police officer is to immediately stop that person and neutralize that threat. We don’t
            expect
            police
            officers to commit suicide in doing it. But the expectation is that if someone is about to harm someone,
            especially
            children, you’ve got to take immediate action to make that stop.</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Many organizations will have multiple levels or circles of leadership. There are leaders who are expected to
        take
        control of situations as they happen. There are also leaders responsible for high-level abstract thinking about
        larger
        issues that lead to the problems throughout their organization. We expect these people to find the commonality
        in a
        myriad of situations that may seem disparate in their details. Leaders at this level must step back and look
        across
        many situations to find root causes and possible improvements that can be made to strengthen the whole system.
        It is
        very important that leaders at this level do not get mired in the details of one specific situation, but rather
        consider the common threads across all events to look for more fundamental changes.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <a href="#small-thinking" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="small-thinking-ref">One of the things that
            everyone
            agreed is don’t have all of these unlocked back doors. Have one door into and
            out
            of the school and have ... armed police officers at that door. </a>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        A well-regarded technique for discovering the root cause of a problem is to complete an exercise called <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Five whys</a>. For example, 19 children and 2 teachers are dead
        in an
        elementary school:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why? A gunman shot them.</li>
        <li>Why? He was a disturbed 18-year-old with access to semi-automatic weapons.</li>
        <li>Why? Texas gun laws allow 18-year-olds to buy semi-automatic weapons without background checks, licensure,
          or
          training.</li>
        <li>Why? Texas politicians have liberalized state gun laws for political and power reasons. This includes more
          open
          access for semi-automatic weapons.</li>
        <li>Why? Without stricter federal gun laws around semi-automatic weapons, states are allowed to push to these
          fringes,
          putting the health of their citizens at risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A leader at the highest levels must make decisions that are sometimes unpopular in certain areas of their
        organization. These decisions aren’t made out of spite for those who disagree, but rather they are made with the
        best
        information, responsibly gathered. A leader will not claim that one decision will solve all the problems in the
        organization. A leader understands that more challenging events will occur in the future, requiring new analysis
        and
        further improvements to the organization. A leader realizes that some decisions will not have the intended
        effect.
        None of these things stops a leader from making decisions that can possibly improve reality right now.</p>
      <p>The constituent responsibilities of a leader should be known throughout the organization. A leader is generally
        responsible to the people and assets in the organization. Sometimes a leader is responsible to outside forces,
        such as
        shareholders. A leader should not seek to increase their constituent responsibilities without having a
        conversation
        with their existing constituent base.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><a href="#corporate-people" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="corporate-people-ref">
            In the years since the
            Supreme Court handed down its decision in Citizens United vs. FEC, hundreds of
            millions of
            dollars have been poured into super PACs, allowing a relatively small group of wealthy individuals and
            corporations
            to exert [anonymously] an outsize influence on local, state and federal elections. </a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A leader talks to their team. A leader tells them hard truths. A leader does the hard thing.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <a href="#how-it-is" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="how-it-is-ref">The folks that feel
            strongly on the right about the Second Amendment, while their heart clearly aches, they
            also
            are deeply concerned about their safety, their family’s safety, and the rhetoric of the left immediately
            jumping to
            their worst fear, which is seizing guns and gun control. It’s an issue that the base needs to be reassured
            and
            spoken to [about] — that they’re not going to get their guns taken away.</a></p>
