      <h1>
        Before They Were Huge
      </h1>

      <p>In my concert going, I donâ€™t think I have had any amazing &quot;before they were big&quot; experiences, but a
        few &quot;on the way up&quot; experiences. Perhaps they'd be called &quot;before they were huge&quot;
        experiences?</p>
      <p>I saw Tenacious D at First Avenue in Minneapolis around 2000. I feel like the D wasn't a huge name, even though
        they had their work on HBO buy that point. Jack Black would become well known within a year, and a superstar
        within three. Still, it was First Avenue, so not exactly a quiet little show.</p>
      <p>I saw Nelly Furtado at some venue that I don't think exists any more. (I looked it up, it was The Quest.) The
        club was probably First-Avenue sized. It was one of those &quot;book a ticket, then she blew up, now the venue
        is way too small&quot; situations. There were lines around the block to get in. My memory says she was sick for
        the performance, but she still performed pretty well.</p>
      <p>Same as Nelly Furtado, I picked up a pair of Mumford &amp; Sons tickets at First Avenue before they exploded.
        By the time we saw them they could have sold out an arena, I think. My wife was seven months pregnant with our
        third. She generally hates going to standing club shows as she's short and claustrophobic. Luckily we found a
        place in the balcony where she could somewhat see, we weren't crowded, and she got a back rub from me for the
        whole show. Other memorable things included the couple next to us dressed up for Halloween/their wedding that
        night, another older couple seemingly there because their recently-deceased son was a huge fan, and the PA
        system going out mid-show with the band handling it amazingly well, singing several a cappella songs with the
        crowd supporting.</p>
