      <h1>
        Beginner's Mind Micro.blog
      </h1>

      <p>
        <em>(Note: I have since moved my primary blog back to a self-designed system, but I am still micro blogging
          at <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com">micro.bjhess.com</a>)</em>
      </p>
      <p>In committing myself to write here at Micro.blog, I <a
          href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/01/14/microblogging.html">had a few hangups</a>. One unspoken in that post
        is the challenge of learning of a new platform. Particularly I just couldn’t write on this platform without
        making the look and feel of it my own. Yes, during last night’s long night I have already succeeded in failing
        my goal to resist customizing my Micro.blog. I enjoy tending my online garden too much.</p>

      <p>It seems useful to share the experience of trying to accomplish tasks when one doesn’t know anything about how
        to do it. (This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin">beginner’s mind</a> adjacent, but I don’t
        think what I’m writing about here represents any sort of a zen-level state of being.) I figured I would write
        out some of the experience of standing things up on the service.</p>

      <p>To be very clear up front, I have quite enjoyed building up my Micro.blog knowledge. The community is
        incredibly supportive. I think the platform walks a pretty good line between being an accessible way to have an
        online presence across micro and traditional blog posts while also providing near infinite flexibility to those
        who really want to dig into things. Much credit must go to <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> and
        team! Back to the brain dump…</p>

      <p>It rapidly became clear that I wasn’t going to allow myself to just roll with a theme as is, so the first step
        was finding a theme that I felt had the bones of what I was looking for. I wanted something that could be
        customized purely with CSS rather than going to <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59">custom
          themes</a>. I suspect I will not be able to avoid custom themes forever, but at the moment <a
          href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> is a mind-bend and I’m trying to honor <em>some</em> of the limits I set for
        myself.</p>

      <p>I clicked through each theme, waiting for my pages to rebuild, and eventually selected the <a
          href="https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-arabica">Arabica theme</a>. This process would have benefitted
        from a more real-time-ish theme chooser, but it wasn’t <em>too</em> time consuming overall.</p>

      <p>Before committing to Micro.blog, I was experimenting with <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a> and wondering if Micro.blog could just
        be a sort of feed aggregator. Micro.blog <a
          href="https://www.manton.org/2018/11/14/activitypub-for-your.html">supports ActivityPub</a> for custom
        domains, but to my memory there was a big warning that this is A One Time Setting You Cannot Change Are You
        Sure?™ I chose micro.bjhess.com as my domain as it made good sense at the time.</p>

      <p>Fast forward to today. My Micro.blog account is really meant to be a blog. I’d rather it sit at
        blog.bjhess.com. The current micro.bjhess.com feels a <em>bit</em> like a “proprietary” landing spot. Though I
        can read about <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domains/53/19">changing domains</a>, I don’t readily
        see a place that I can do it in my account. Now, rather than a year from now, would be the time to deal with 48
        hours of weirdness in my site. I’ll have to dig around more to see if it’s possible. If it’s not possible, no
        big deal.</p>

      <p>My goal was to structure the site with a <strong>Blog</strong>, a place for micro posts that I’m calling
        <strong>Ephemera</strong>, and an area to collect things I like that I’m calling <strong>Commonplace</strong>.
        It wasn’t incredibly obvious to me how I was going to do this. Categories seemed like a part of the solution,
        and I <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68">found they do their job</a>. Incidentally, <a
          href="https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68">category auto filtering</a> is pretty genius!</p>

      <p>(For a few hours I really struggled to find information on how to best used the service. Eventually I realized
        that searching <a href="https://help.micro.blog">help.micro.blog</a> for answers worked pretty well. I’m so
        conditioned to web search “[problem] [example.com]”. It’s a hard habit to break.)</p>

      <p>As I thought more about the <strong>Commonplace</strong> section, I decided that should just be a
        manually-managed page that links out to subcategories (quotes, poetry, and so on). It was not obvious to me how
        to do this, but <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-category-pages/796/2">some friendly help</a> taught me
        that I could just make additional pages and change their URL scheme to look like
        <code>/categories/quotes</code>. Pretty easy in the end.</p>

      <p>CSS styling has been incredibly simple and fast to implement. I’ve mostly adjusted the fonts, colors, and link
        interactions. As a developer by trade, I naturally wish I could be editing CSS on my machine. Not having source
        control gets me itchy all over as well, but that’s to be expected.</p>

      <p>There are some things that I still think I’d like to customize, but I wish I could do it without delving into
        custom themes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I might like my homepage to be something more “traditional web page” with an introduction to myself, what’s
          at the site, and so on.</li>
        <li>Or I might like my homepage to simply be my longer-form blog posts. For me this site is a blog, with micro
          posts and a commonplace book alongside it. This and the above point <a
            href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-home-page/62">can be done through custom themes</a>.</li>
        <li>I would like to have some intro text on my categories pages, but this again appears to require custom
          themes. Having some sort of smartcode or magic keyword that can be used to plop in category listings could
          work well. This might be an extension of how <a
            href="https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68">categories are added to navigation</a>.</li>
        <li>I would like my primary feed to be the blog feed. Secondarily, I would like to have a link to the <a
            href="https://micro.bjhess.com/uploads/2022/0102806d25.gif">firehose</a> for people who want it all. Custom
          themes!</li>
        <li>On your blog posts pages, it appears you can either have replies shown or relegate them to the Micro.blog
          timeline. I’d like a couple of other options here in a drop down: show link to reply on Micro.blog and show
          link to reply via email. I think there is a plugin for the latter, so maybe a plugin will pop up at some point
          for the former as well.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Finally, I’m a bit concerned about the future Hugo upgrade process and how my customizations will play with it.
        At that point I will probably have to delve into <a
          href="https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html">test blogs</a>. I’m thankful for their
        existence, but found them a little hard to approach in this initial site build up.</p>

      <p>Again, Micro.blog is quite a fascinating and fun piece of software. I feel very good about my choice to jump in
        and give it a try!</p>
