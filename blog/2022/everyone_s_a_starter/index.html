      <h1>
        Everyone's a Starter
      </h1>

      <p>Through the years I have participated in all sorts of groups. There have been sports teams, both individually
        focused and team focused. There have been staff positions, working as a group to support students. There have
        been traditional jobs, which generally combine both the individual competition with group support.</p>

      <p>Out of all these my favorite form of group activity has been the musical group. A successful musical group is
        trying to lift everyone in the group up. While there are often soloists and “star players,” the importance of
        each participant is nearly identical. So the group tries to encourage and inspire their lesser players to rise
        to the occasion.</p>

      <p>This doesn’t seem to result in a homogenization of talent, but rather a growth of skills across all the
        participants. Everyone feels like they could be better. Everyone’s efforts matter. My high school band director
        liked to compare it to athletic teams when he would say, “Everyone’s a starter.”</p>

      <p>It strikes me as curious that there are not a lot of successful examples of this attitude in business. I’ve
        seen some similarities as I’ve looked at young businesses. On paper they have the intention to be a supportive
        group that builds each other up. As they grow they write <em>more</em> about this intention while building
        structures directly in conflict with that goal. Creating salary bands and role differentiation that explicitly
        says, “These jobs are not of the same value.”</p>

      <p>I wonder if a business could be built and maintained in a way that carries on indefinitely the idea of a
        supportive group where everyone is a starter? I wonder if human nature would allow the participants to maintain
        that attitude over many years of working together? I wonder how compensation could be defined to best support
        this structure?</p>

      <p>I’m going to leave those things as questions for now. Perhaps they are good fodder for future thinking.</p>
