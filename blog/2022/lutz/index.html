      <h1>
        Lutz
      </h1>

      <p>If you watched the television show <em>30 Rock</em> you may remember the lovable loser <a
          href="https://30rock.fandom.com/wiki/Lutz">J.D. Lutz</a>. Years ago on a visit to NYC I was able to see John
        Lutz
        (who portrayed the Lutz character), <a href="https://30rock.fandom.com/wiki/Pete_Hornberger">Scott Adsit</a>,
        and <a href="https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/Ted_Lasso_Photo_010302.jpg">Jason
          Sudeikis</a> perform
        improv at the Upright Citizens Brigade theater. They werenâ€™t firing on all cylinders that night, which is just
        how
        improv goes sometimes, but it still got me curious to bring up some Wikipedia pages after I returned home.</p>

      <p>As I loaded the page for John Lutz, my eyes rolled to the right as usual to look at the biographic overview. I
        skimmed, started returning back to the article, and then made an audible noise as my brain caught up with my
        vision,
        which had returned to that bio section. That couldnâ€™t be!</p>

      <p><img src="images/lutz.png" style="border-radius: 0;" alt="Lutz" /></p>

      <p>I kind of laugh when people claim we should doubt all of Wikipedia just because sometimes its facts arenâ€™t
        quite
        right. First, how did you know that <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> had all of <em>its</em> facts right? Errors
        probably slipped in. Yet my years of ongoing subconscious laughter ended abruptly when I saw what I was seeing.
        Perhaps all this Wikipedia stuff was truly a mix of fifty percent fact, fifty percent fiction.</p>
      <p>On this little Wikipedia bio was I really reading that John Micahel Lutz was supposedly born in my hometown?!
        Could
        this be true?</p>
      <p>I grew up in a sparsely populated corner of Minnesota. The town housed 5,000 people. The entirety of my home
        county
        only contained 10,000 souls. Just as Minnesota claims any famous person remotely associated with the state (ðŸ‘‹
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Vaughn">Vince Vaughn</a>, <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Biel">Jessica Biel</a>, and <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seann_William_Scott">Stifler</a>), every Minnesota town does the same for
        its
        past residents. Where I grew up we were treated annually to newspaper articles about <a
          href="https://seinfeld.fandom.com/wiki/Phil_Bruns">Phil Bruns</a>, who played Morty Seinfeld for one episode
        before
        being replaced.</p>
      <p>Bruns would also write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper once or twice a year. He would comment on
        local
        events he had read in the newspaper, or perhaps share worldly goings-on that he thought might be beneficial for
        us
        rural
        folk to hear. He seemed to genuinely want to stay connected to this place he had left so long ago. My perception
        at
        the time was that he enjoyed getting attention because the rest of the world probably didnâ€™t really know who he
        was. A
        little bit of fame was better than none at all.</p>
      <p>My mother-in-law loves to research genealogy so I asked her to put the truth to this lie that Lutz was born
        where I
        was born. How could it be that this star was in our midst, but our local newspaper had yet to pick up on it? To
        my
        great surprise she did some digging and discovered that, indeed, he had been born where Wikipedia said he was
        born.
        His brother was also born in the same small town. His family lived in the area for at least four years before
        moving
        on.</p>
      <p>So one more time this small town is famous, though it hasnâ€™t yet realized it. Maybe someday Iâ€™ll tip them to
        the
        truth. And to be fair, Phil Bruns actually had a long working career as an <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6UCtj4T1ac">actor</a>. Once again proving I donâ€™t know what I donâ€™t
        know!</p>
