      <h1>
        Markdown to HTML on macOS
      </h1>

      <p>So maybe you’ve decided to move your blog or website to an <a href="/blog/2022/HTML-only/">HTML only
          workflow</a>.
        Congratulations on joining our little movement!</p>
      <p>So you’ve written a few posts or pages in straight HTML. Maybe you’ve noticed that you link to things less
        often
        because typing <code>&lt;a href...</code> gets to be a little cumbersome. That’s okay! A lot of sites are a bit
        too
        linky for my tastes. Maybe you’ve wanted to make some sweet unordered lists, but it felt a bit too cumbersome.
        Maybe
        your code editor could help you a bit more, but you haven’t gotten around to improving it yet.</p>
      <p>So now you want to write a more sizable post and you’re kind of wishing you had access to Markdown. You said
        your
        site is HTML now and caving in to a static site generator would feel so wrong. There’s got to be another
        way!</p>
      <p>(Oh my goodness, this feels like those excruciating intros recipe websites are filled with. I’m so sorry!)</p>
      <p>If you’re on macOS, I have an option for you and it involves my old friend, Automator! This does introduce code
        and
        dependencies to your simple, HTML workflow, but maybe it’s light enough to not be a big deal?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Do you already use homebrew? If so, install <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cmark">cmark</a>:
          <pre><code class="language-zsh">brew install cmark
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Find where your cmark is installed:
          <pre><code class="language-zsh">% which cmark
/opt/homebrew/bin/cmark
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Open Automator and at the prompt create a new <strong>Quick Action</strong>:
          <a href="images/automator-quick-action.png"><img src="images/automator-quick-action.png"></a>
        </li>
        <li>Set it up like this, using your cmark installation location as found in step 2:
          <a href="images/automator-markdown-to-html.png"><img src="images/automator-markdown-to-html.png"></a>

        </li>
        <li>Save that Automator script. I called it <strong>Markdown &gt; HTML</strong>.</li>
        <li>Write your blog post in your preferred markdown editor (mine is iA Writer), select the text, and click (for
          example) <strong>iA Writer &gt; Services &gt; Markdown &gt; HTML</strong>.</li>
        <li>The HTML is now on your clipboard, ready to be pasted into your HTML post/page template.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Yes, this introduces dependencies on cmark and Automator. Good thing is if these ever break you can just go
        back to
        HTML editing or most markdown editors have an “export to HTML” option.</p>
