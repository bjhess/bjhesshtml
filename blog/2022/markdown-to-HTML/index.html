      <h1>
        Markdown to HTML on macOS
      </h1>

      <p>So maybe you’ve decided to move your blog or website to an <a href="/blog/2022/HTML-only/">HTML only
          workflow</a>.
        Congratulations on joining our little movement!</p>
      <p>So you’ve written a few posts or pages in straight HTML. Maybe you’ve noticed that you link to things less
        often
        because typing <code>&lt;a href...</code> gets to be a little cumbersome. That’s okay! A lot of sites are a bit
        too
        linky for my tastes. Maybe you’ve wanted to make some sweet unordered lists, but it felt a bit too cumbersome.
        Maybe
        your code editor could help you a bit more, but you haven’t gotten around to improving it yet.</p>
      <p>So now you want to write a more sizable post and you’re kind of wishing you had access to Markdown. You said
        your
        site is HTML now and caving in to a static site generator would feel so wrong. There’s got to be another
        way!</p>
      <p>(Oh my goodness, this feels like those excruciating intros recipe websites are filled with. I’m so sorry!)</p>
      <p>If you’re on macOS, I have an option for you and it involves my old friend, Automator! This does introduce code
        and
        dependencies to your simple, HTML workflow, but maybe it’s light enough to not be a big deal?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Do you already use homebrew? If so, install <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cmark">cmark</a>:
          <pre><code class="language-zsh">brew install cmark
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Find where your cmark is installed:
          <pre><code class="language-zsh">% which cmark
/opt/homebrew/bin/cmark
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Open Automator and at the prompt create a new <strong>Quick Action</strong>:
          <a href="images/automator-quick-action.png"><img src="images/automator-quick-action.png"></a>
        </li>
        <li>Set it up like this, using your cmark installation location as found in step 2:
          <a href="images/automator-markdown-to-html.png"><img src="images/automator-markdown-to-html.png"></a>

        </li>
        <li>Save that Automator script. I called it <strong>Markdown &gt; HTML</strong>.</li>
        <li>Write your blog post in your preferred markdown editor (mine is iA Writer), select the text, and click (for
          example) <strong>iA Writer &gt; Services &gt; Markdown &gt; HTML</strong>.</li>
        <li>The HTML is now on your clipboard, ready to be pasted into your HTML post/page template.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Yes, this introduces dependencies on cmark and Automator. Good thing is if these ever break you can just go
        back to
        HTML editing or most markdown editors have an “export to HTML” option.</p>

              I stumbled across your site on Bradley's comment section. I read your
              posts about sharing your html setup.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm writing to you to share my "setup".
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not convinced to use SSGs or Markdown (sorry). I think it adds
              complexity but end up the result being the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              I set up my "blog" using plain html as well, with a bit help of php.
              Every time i write a post i hand code html tags...in VS code.
              I admit it's quite troublesome at times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Good thing is, you can inject "new elements" into html at anytime, such
              as &lt;figure&gt;,&lt;details&gt; without worrying "compile".
            </p>
            <p>
              You can customize your site and write a post at the same time.
              I've got a habit to update html structure here and there.<br />
              This is very fun.<br />

              A little about me is that I'm from Hong Kong and just started to blog
              this year. I'm trying with my english and to learn things on the fediverse.

                  Thanks for sharing your journey, Jw! I have definitely considered adding PHP into the mix for some
                  simple dynamic features. Another alternative I've considered is hosting with Apache so that I can use
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes">server side includes</a>. Since I'm
                  hosting at GitHub Pages, those options aren't currently on the table, however, so I'm going to see how
                  long I can stick with just HTML.
