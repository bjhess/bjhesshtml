        Now Blogging at Micro.blog
      </h1>

      <p>tl;dnr: <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com">micro.bjhess.com</a></p>

      <p>Rather than continuing to maintain a stale version of someone’s cool-for-2014 blogging software here on my own
        server, I have decided to take my blogging to a new home: <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>. It pains
        me a bit to release some of this control, but Micro.blog is very open and will not be locking down my data in
        any way. With any luck it continues as is for decades, with my blog running alongside it.</p>

      <p>So head over to <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com">micro.bjhess.com</a> to check it out. EVEN BETTER would be
        to join me in blogging there!</p>

      <p>For the 10 people who might still be accessing this RSS feed, please follow that feed over there. The primary
        feed will have both my longer form blog posts and my micro posts. If that’s too much for your taste, here is a
        <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/categories/blog/feed.xml">feed for just the blog posts</a>.</p>

      <p>Oh, and one more thing: this sort of means comments are back in play on my blog for the time being. <a
          href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> accounts are free for things like following Micro.bloggers and
        replying to their (my) posts.</p>
