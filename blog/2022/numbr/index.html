        Numbr
      </h1>

      <p>I find <a href="https://numbr.dev">Numbr</a> to be a fascinating piece of software. It is totally
        understandable that someone would build a version of the <a href="https://soulver.app">Soulver</a> calculator in
        the browser. Who wouldn’t want that?</p>

      <p>My fascination level doubled when I realized there was no backend to this software. The state of what has been
        typed on the screen is stored in the URL, compressed and base64 encoded. When you send a link of your document
        to someone else all of the information is stored in the URL, and thus they see what you see.</p>

      <p>This state-in-the-URL is handy for my financial <a
          href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/01/26/tab-groups-in.html">tab group</a>. When I sit down to pay the bills
        (RE: pay the credit cards), Numbr is the first tab I see. I don’t need to dig through a service’s interface to
        find my document or spreadsheet. It has all the miscellaneous calculations I felt I needed the last time I
        worked with my finances. I can tweak and edit the document from there, building it upon itself.</p>

      <p>It’s a novel approach to building software. And it’s pretty.</p>
