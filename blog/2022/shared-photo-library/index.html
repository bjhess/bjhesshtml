      <h1>
        Shared Photo Library
      </h1>

      <p>I am guardedly optimistic about Apple’s <a
          href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/06/apple-unveils-new-ways-to-share-and-communicate-in-ios-16/">announcement</a>
        of an iCloud Shared Photo Library. Since we moved from primarily digital cameras to two parents snapping
        pictures with
        two phones storing them in the cloud, photo library management has been a pain. The desire to keep things simple
        meant
        that I did not go out and look for an alternative to Apple’s iCloud solution. So my only option was to make my
        library
        the main one, each year exporting everything from my wife’s library to merge in to the main library.</p>
      <p>With iOS 16, it seems there will be options for family sharing, which sounds great now that we have five phones
        in
        our family snapping pictures and storing them in the cloud.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>iCloud Shared Photo Library gives families a new way to share photos seamlessly with a separate iCloud
          library that
          up to six users can collaborate on, contribute to, and enjoy. Users can choose to share existing photos from
          their
          personal libraries, or <em>share based on a start date</em> or people in the photos.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Sharing based on start date <em>sounds</em> like the thing we’ll want, at least on the parent side. What we
        truly
        want as parents is a unified library such that each of us can browse any picture either of us took or imported
        through
        all time.</p>
      <p>Looking at the screenshots of this in action makes me a little less hopeful. Apple shares one screenshot of
        photo
        selection with the option to “Move to Shared Library.” What does this mean? Are the photos duplicated into the
        shared
        library, <a href="https://devdojo.com/devdojo/what-is-a-symlink">symlinked</a> in, or literally moved out of my
        library and into the shared library? And this doesn’t sound great, especially when sharing with children:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Moving these 5 items to the Shared Library will allow all Shared Library participants to view, edit or delete
          this
          content at any time.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>No, this isn’t feeling quite like what I want. Or maybe it’s just part of what I want. I would like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A unified library with my wife. Yes, I suppose we each should have edit and delete rights to that library,
          though
          some user controls would be nice. I know she would appreciate some protection from accidentally deleting
          photos.
        </li>
        <li>A view-only library with my family. I would like my children to have access to all our historical family
          photos,
          but I would prefer they not be able to accidentally delete anything. I would also like them to be able to add
          photos
          to our family library.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It seems like both of those things could be supported with a few individual user permissions. We shall see how
        Apple
        implements this. Maybe it will work fine as a wide-open, anyone-can-do-anything library as long as I have a good
        incremental backup system in tow to save us from any accidents.</p>
