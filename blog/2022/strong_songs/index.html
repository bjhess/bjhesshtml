        Strong Songs
      </h1>

      <p>Somewhere recently I ran into the podcast <a href="https://strongsongspodcast.com"><em>Strong Songs</em></a>
        and I’m quite enjoying it. I’m curious about the genesis and formation of songs, and have listened to a few <a
          href="https://songexploder.net"><em>Song Exploder</em></a> episodes accordingly, but <em>Strong Songs</em>
        comes at it from a more music-nerd angle.</p>

      <p><em>Strong Songs</em> isn’t interviewing the original artist. Rather, it’s looking at the music theory of the
        songs themselves. It’s talking about the chord structure and instrumentation. It’s digging into the music
        history that informs the songs it features. It’s showing how music is a long, long story being told by many
        authors. (That’s a cool idea, which I stole from the podcast.)</p>

      <p>It can get a bit technical at times, and some of it runs over my head, but I still find it largely enjoyable.
      </p>

      <p>So far I’ve listened to these interesting episodes – there have been fascinating parts to each of them:</p>
