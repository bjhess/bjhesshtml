      <h1>
        They Might Be Giants Flood Tour
      </h1>

      <p>This past Saturday my family all had plans, so I took the opportunity to try something I’ve been meaning to try
        for a while: attend a concert alone. The advantage of loner concert attendance is that you can often get
        last-minute tickets in good seats for a great price. My friend, Patrick, also suggests that going alone can be
        quite fun as you aren’t concerned with making sure your friends are having a good time; you can just enjoy your
        experience.</p>
      <p>So I picked up a ticket to see They Might Be Giants. I’m not a rabid fan of the band, but I’ve spun
        <em>Flood</em> a million times and this tour was celebrating <em>Flood</em> with the promise that every song
        from
        the album would be played. I was pretty pumped!</p>
      <p>The ticket was not a steal, but it was a fair price for the second row. My ideal seats are generally more in
        the
        tenth to fifteenth rows, but this seemed like a good time to try a close concert. The downsides were real. My
        views were obstructed, especially to the horn section. My neck was craned and a bit sore. The upside in this
        case
        was that those around me were pretty big fans and that meant a lot of good energy.</p>
      <p>Patrick’s promise of enjoyment when going alone played out pretty well. I had zero concerns for anyone else
        having fun, just enjoying the moment myself. I certainly like going with other people, but I’ll also be content
        to
        go alone if there aren’t any takers for a given show. Especially if I can steal a deal.</p>
      <p>I’ve been to a number of concerts over late summer and this fall: The Decemberists, The Shins, Tenacious D, and
        Nick Mason to name a few. The reason I’m finally writing a post is because I wanted to document some things
        about
        TMBG’s horn section for myself. That’s when I remembered, hey, I have a blog. Maybe that’s a good place to
        write?!
      </p>
      <p>On this tour the band was traveling with three horn players who primarily played trumpet, tenor sax, and
        trombone. They were phenomenal!</p>
      <p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Harrison">Stan Harrison</a> played a killer tenor sax, taking a
        couple of solos throughout the night. <a href="https://tmbw.net/wiki/Dan_Levine">Dan Levine</a> had an
        outstanding
        trombone solo, but the highlight for me is when he came out for a euphonium solo. That was the instrument I
        played
        throughout high school and college. Woo!</p>
      <p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pender">Mark Pender</a> played trumpet in The Max Weinberg 7 on
        <em>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</em>. He has played with Bruce Springsteen along with numerous other artists
        and
        he absolutely honked. During “Istanbul (Not Constantinople)” he had a solo, followed by about three minutes of
        playing a single note. It was absurd. You can get an idea from <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3UwW3fidxU">this Conan clip</a>. (I love in that clip when Conan asks
        when he’ll stop, the band says, “Maybe when he’s sixty.” Nope, because he’s in his sixties now and still doing
        it!)</p>
      <p>All this is to say, if you are even a small fan of TMBG, I highly recommend seeing them in concert. And if you
        enjoy bands with a horn section, you’re not going to do much better than a TMBG gig with horns. The band clearly
        attracts the best of the best to play with them. Get yourself to a show!</p>
