      <h1>
        Trying Phoenix and Elixir
      </h1>

      <p>Earlier this year I surprised myself and <a
          href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/02/04/google-programming-in.html">got back into daily programming</a>.
        It’s been quite a trip and mostly fun. The part that has been the most frustrating is when I solve a problem one
        week only to have the same problem again next week, but I can’t quite remember how I solved it. I have tried to
        minimize that issue a bit by keeping <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/02/16/logtxt.html">a log</a>.</p>

      <p>Just when I’ve started to get rolling, I am surprising myself again by picking up <a
          href="https://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> for my
        next project. About eighteen months ago, before this web-project bug hit me, I did try to book-learn myself some
        Phoenix. Without a project to work on, or even a desire to come up with a project, I fell off the practice
        rather quickly.</p>

      <p>I have never been a deep-diver of programming languages and frameworks. I don’t find the details of how things
        work to be that interesting on their own. I find the fact that these open source tools <em>exist</em> at all to
        be the amazing part, and it turns out I very much enjoy them to build things. The quickly-built things are what
        excite me.</p>

      <p>Fast forward to today. After standing up three prototypes with Ruby on Rails, I reminded myself of another
        thing that really makes me happy: fast websites. I’m building prototypes here, with hopes no higher than
        eventually serving a few thousand people on an app that catches on in its little niche. There is no practical
        reason for me to move from Rails. It’s certainly fast enough to handle the things I want to build. As experience
        is (re)gained, the workflow is quite nice. And while it’s hard to find things on Google, there is a lot of
        hard-won knowledge out there, including my own experiences with the framework, which are certainly buried
        somewhere in my brain.</p>

      <p>Elixir and the Phoenix framework promise better performance on the basic web things; probably by a factor of
        five or ten. On top of that, the authors were inspired by Ruby and Rails, so they have been able to largely keep
        the “developer happiness” goals of those inspirational technologies alive in their own developments.</p>

      <p>As I go through the book learning, it has been remarkably quick to stand up a simple application in Phoenix.
        Certainly I will be slowed down as I learn to embrace a new framework, a new mode of programming (functional
        declarative rather than object oriented), and a less-magical way of doing things. Okay, the latter might net out
        positive very quickly.</p>

      <p>I realize the performance of my applications might not be all that noticeable, especially if they include
        multimedia assets like photos and videos, but the promise of simply not worrying about scaling for a very long
        time is a good one. The promise of apps that are not resource-needy and that are cheap to run is great for
        someone building many prototypes each year. The promise of serving thousands of connections cheaply for live
        websocket interactions is quite exciting. The promise of tests that run blazingly fast makes me smile.</p>

      <p>So here I go. Maybe I’ll be even happier building apps over the next couple months. Or maybe I’ll fall back to
        Rails, my comfort zone. Either option will be a pretty great place to be.</p>
