        Two Newsletters
      </h1>

      <p>
        Another newsletter? Who needs that! You might not, but I guess I do. And so I have started up a second
        newsletter, <a href="https://goodenoughnews.substack.com">A Good Enough Newsletter</a> with my friend <a
          href="https://mrshawnliu.com">Shawn</a>. We're not entirely sure where this one's
        going, but it's been fun so far.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of you are probably saying, "Barry, how can you have another newsletter when you don't have a first
        newsletter?" Good question! (Just kidding. That's not a very good question. A cursory look around my site
        <em>should</em> bring you to <a href="/">my homepage</a>, which should allow you to discover my newsletter. If
        not, you have an attention-to-detail problem.) My monthly newsletter, <a
          href="https://buttondown.email/bjhess">March of Time</a>, has been running for a while now, but 2022 found it
        hitting a good cadence of personal stories mixed
        with blog content and other discoveries.
