      <h1>
        Video Gaming vs Videos of Gaming
      </h1>

      <p>Over the past couple months I’ve rekindled my enjoyment of playing city-building video games. I feel that
        SimCity might be one of the greatest gaming inventions of all time. I played the original a little bit, but
        SimCity 2000 is where I got serious. I was certainly addicted to the game even though I did not have a computer
        on which to play it. I invited myself over to a friend’s house daily to play and I also played on the computer
        in the band room of my high school.</p>

      <p>While the SimCity franchise still exists, the new hotness is <a
          href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines/about">Cities: Skylines</a>. (Okay, it’s not
        new. The game came out in early 2015!) I’ve been playing it when I have some time, or when I feel like replacing
        sleep with gaming. It’s pretty fun and seems to have evolved in a lot of the ways we gamers would have liked
        SimCity to have evolved.</p>

      <p>As with any hobby or past-time, I also began watching YouTube videos about the game. I had questions. How do
        you best lay out a traffic grid? How do you best resolve traffic flow problems? How do you best zone
        high-density versus low-density areas? How do you mitigate pollution? How does noise pollution interact with
        residential areas?</p>

      <p>One of the most interesting channels I’ve run across is an urban planner who plays the game, offering
        instructions on how to build a city with a flair for actual city planning. I’ve been watching his <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu8YwpngbzE&amp;list=PLXdi-Ns7w3jjfNPMl836BKjxZONnxvXPw">Ultimate
          Beginners Guide series</a> where he is building up a city bit by bit through all sorts of different
        neighborhood styles and amenity additions. I find it very interesting!</p>

      <p>Something I’ve noticed is that I <em>might</em> get more enjoyment from watching these progressive
        city-building videos than from playing the game myself. Watching the videos feels just about the same as
        playing, except it’s as if I’m <em>better</em> at playing. It feels like I’m making discoveries organically
        while watching, which is definitely not how it feels when playing. When playing I run into road blocks where I
        can’t figure out how to do something or I know that I’m doing something ineffectively. I hit the friction of
        leaving the game to figure out the best way. I hit the friction of wrestling with the aging user interface
        (remember, it was initially released in 2015). All those things are easy when watching videos.</p>

      <p>There is probably a name for this phenomenon, but I don’t feel like digging it up. It finally explains to me
        why things like Twitch have taken off in the past decade. I can see the entertainment value of feeling like
        you’re playing a game <em>really well</em> and also getting additional enjoyment from the host commentary.</p>

      <p>What I do know is that I’m hitting a point where I’m wondering if I should keep investing energy in the game or
        if I should just embrace watching the videos or if I should just break the addictive cycle and do something else
        with my time.</p>
