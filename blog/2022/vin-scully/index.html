      <h1>
        Vin Scully
      </h1>

      <p>Vin Scully <a href="https://twitter.com/Dodgers/status/1554667166351253506">passed away</a> last week. He lived
        a
        good life. He lived a charmed life. He lived a life that touched tens of millions of people.</p>
      <p>As the 90s wore on, I got away from baseball. I was busy with music and my teens and college. Yet during my
        childhood and tweens I was in love with the game. When I wasn’t playing on a youth traveling team, I played solo
        games in my yard every single day of the summer. My evenings found me listening to the Minnesota Twins game on
        my
        bedside clock radio, often scratching out the action in a scorebook that I kept beside me. Baseball was my
        sport, and
        the radio announcers were my eyes and ears.</p>
      <p>In the 2000s I started to revisit that love, though it had turned into the softer, conditional joy of
        adulthood. The
        Internet was growing exponentially, and that meant I could relive a bit of what I missed. Though it turned out
        to be
        a drug-fueled resurfacing of the game atop the public consciousness, I was saving pictures of Cal Ripken’s
        consecutive-game record and the home run races between Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, and Barry Bonds. History was
        happening now and I wanted these artifacts on my computer so I could share them with grandchildren someday. Some
        of
        these items probably still reside on a hard drive somewhere in my home, but they are tainted by steroids and
        business
        such that I’ll never have that gather-round-grandpa moment down the road; at least not about baseball.</p>
      <p>One thing survived, coming through without tarnish, and that is my saved audio recording of Vin Scully calling
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WINiz0Bfb-0">Sandy Koufax’s 1965 perfect game</a> (<a
          href="https://www.salon.com/1999/10/12/scully_koufax/">text version</a>). While it wasn’t about the 90s, it
        was
        about the baseball I had missed. It is a work of art. I love it.</p>
      <p>In the 2010s I found myself with access to an MLB.TV account. While I couldn’t watch my own team because
        business
        means they were blacked out, I could turn on the Dodgers feed just to listen to Scully talk. It was a soothing
        way to
        wind down from a day. It was a background soundtrack that none of us deserved, but we were thankful nonetheless.
        Even
        in his eighties we were treated to the results of his tireless research. His stories could touch any player,
        veteran
        or rookie. I enjoyed so much learning about the school exploits of the opposing team’s Orange County prospect.
        Scully
        could make tangible the incredible excitement that must be fluttering in the kid’s stomach as he took the mound
        against his childhood-favorite team.</p>
      <p>Scully was a legendary storyteller who would <a
          href="https://twitter.com/soxmachine/status/1554695886281793540">teach the fans of opposing teams about their
          own
          players</a>. He also taught us about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYbCDQAfD4M">Greek legends</a>,
        staging perfectly a game moment that he couldn’t have known was coming. While I don’t believe Scully was ever
        political, he also made sure to react properly when <a
          href="https://twitter.com/ChrisVannini/status/1554673894325362688">discussing the evil in the world</a>.</p>
      <p>I cannot understand why we do not seem to have even a low-rent knock-off of Scully. People who have a love for
        an
        activity tend try to emulate their heroes. There are certainly people who are passionate about broadcasting, but
        I’ve
        yet to run into an announcer who appeared to do a fraction of the research Scully must have done to prepare for
        his
        work. Maybe there are business things at play here that don’t allow it to happen. That’s unfortunate as I’d be
        angry
        if suits out there are suppressing someone that is working their butts off to do what Scully did.</p>
      <p>Hopefully there are filmmakers working on a documentary on Scully. Maybe one already exists? I don’t really
        want a
        documentary about his life so much, though I would watch it. What I want is a documentary highlighting his top
        moments. <em>All levels</em> of moments, whether they be about <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjqYThEVoSQ">Hank Aaron’s homerun</a> or role players like DeWayne Wise.
        What
        I want is for Apple TV+ or whatever network to have a Vin Scully channel that plays all day every day forever.
      </p>
      <p>I’m thankful to have lived in a time where I could listen to Vin Scully describe the game I so enjoy and I’m
        happy to
        <a href="https://joeposnanski.substack.com/p/vin-scully-1927-2022">shower you with applause</a> one last time.
