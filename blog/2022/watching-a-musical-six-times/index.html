      <h1>
        Watching a Musical Six Times
      </h1>

      <p>Over the prior couple of weeks my oldest has been part of the pit orchestra for the high school musical. She
        really enjoys musicals in general, and this has been a great way for her to be involved in one. Especially since
        she’s not a singer or dancer or actor.</p>

      <p>Over the years we’ve noticed that some families who have kids in the musical will go to almost every
        performance. I always thought this was pretty absurd. It can be as many as seven or eight performances some
        years and, well, don’t they have anything better to do?</p>

      <p>When my time came to make the obvious decision to spread my time among many various pursuits I made the clear
        choice and … attended almost every one of her performances. There were not many other things going on in my
        February life. Every afternoon when I thought I’d sit out that night I realized my evening activities were
        destined to be watching something on television or playing a video game. My other two daughters as well as my
        wife wanted to go to the musical every night. So what better choice did I have?</p>

      <p>I found seeing the musical over many performances to be a different experience than simply watching a musical
        one time. It was a little like attending a sporting event. I could see who had stronger performances on a given
        night. I could see someone stepping up with increased confidence. I could notice changes from prior nights. And
        like a sporting event, we talked about these differences amongst ourselves when the performance was over.</p>

      <p>I gained an appreciation for each kid’s take on their character. We all have preferences and those often
        dictate how we judge the quality of a performance at the end of the night. Over time, though, I would realize
        that the kid who I thought was very mediocre on night one was actually doing some pretty great work with their
        character. Perhaps I didn’t love their take on it, but I could tell they were working really hard to do exactly
        what they were doing.</p>

      <p>Do I recommend watching a musical this many times in a short period? I mean, probably not. I actually think
        with professional performers it would be more boring than with student performers. Professionals probably hit
        their marks and notes with great accuracy, making a six-performance engagement more similar to watching the same
        movie six times. If you have a kid involved, though, and if you know a lot of the other student cast members, it
        can be a pretty interesting way to spend fifteen hours in the dead of winter.</p>
