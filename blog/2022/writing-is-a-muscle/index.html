      <h1>
        Writing Is a Muscle
      </h1>

      <p>As I put together this new blog, I am going through old links and inspirations. I have collected a fair pile of
        inspirations of the design, content, and attitude sorts. Though it shouldn’t be surprising, I’m still kind taken
        back about how vital the attitude bits have been to getting me moving. Rereading these things is also a
        compounding sort of positive pressure in that it makes me want to document the inspirations. I have started
        preparing some of this stuff for <a href="/commonplace/">Commonplace</a>. Guess what putting things into
        Commonplace makes me want to do: think about and write more things. Yay!</p>

      <p>At some point along the way I ran into Matt Webb’s <a
          href="https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/10/streak">15 rules for blogging, and my current streak</a>. I
        skimmed it a bit back then, but wrote it down for later discovery. It’s a very nice set of rules. I think many
        folks could take away some attitudes that would help them get to writing more. In fact his final rule, “Writing
        is a muscle,” is a call to write more.</p>

      <p>This whole experience in finding and reminding myself of a past discovery has me shedding my hang-ups with the
        ephemera I’m writing to this blog. As Matt says, writing is a muscle. While I don’t
        want to dive into the social of Twitter or its ilk, that doesn’t mean jotting off short bursts of words isn’t a
        valuable exercise. Maybe I should be more <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/135/">Craig Mod</a> and temper
        my “pathology [of] keeping around so much digital cruft,” but right now I find the working of the muscles
        useful. If I change my mind, there is nothing to stop me from auto-deleting week-old digital cruft as Craig
        does.</p>
