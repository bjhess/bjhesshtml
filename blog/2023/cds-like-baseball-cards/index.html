      <h1>
        CDs Like Baseball Cards
      </h1>

      <p>This summer my two youngest (fifteen and eleven) expressed an interest in getting into vinyl. While I was
        excited,
        because I love music and music collecting is dear to me, I saw problems with this plan. Vinyl requires a lot of
        space
        for storage. It is finicky and requires some special equipment. As my kids grow older I could see that dorm
        rooms and
        small apartments may not be the best place for a vinyl collection. Perhaps that wasn’t the best place to start.
      </p>
      <p>So I suggested CDs. To this younger set, they are still interesting. They are still physical. They still have
        artwork
        and liner notes. As an object, vinyl still beats CDs, I think, but they can always progress there if they’d
        like. Oh,
        and playing a CD is a much more straightforward process.</p>
      <p>To kick start their collection I headed to eBay. I bought tens of discs with their original cases and they
        shopped
        through this initial collection. Then I ran into one other place to really build a fast collection and that is
        random
        100-disc CD spindles.</p>

      <p>When ordering these, I expected about a 5% hit rate of interesting discs. I was totally wrong. While there
        certainly
        weren’t eighty good discs in each spindle, there were many, many worthwhile albums. Some were scratched, but
        most
        worked fine. All of us ended up adding lots of them to our collections. It was entertaining and reminded me a
        lot of
        opening baseball cards as a kid.</p>
      <p>What follows are some pictures of the opening as well as some particularly choice finds. Enjoy!</p>
