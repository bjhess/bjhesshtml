        Rails Form Redirect Not Rendering HTML
      </h1>

      <p>Recently our login and sign up forms on <a href="https://doevery.day/">Do Every Day</a> broke. After submitting
        the
        forms, it appeared to the user that the same form page reloaded and you did not get logged in or signed up.
        Reloading
        the page the user would discover that they were indeed logged in, but who actually did that? This was especially
        unfortunate because Do Every Day had just been featured on <a
          href="https://blog.google/products/registry/google-registry-is-collaborating-with-un-organizations/">this
          Google
          blog post</a>.</p>
      <p>I believe things broke along the way as I upgraded Rails and the <a
          href="https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails">turbo-rails</a> gem, generally for security updates. Turbo is
        relatively new and has been changing rapidly. While I have a decent test suite on the Do Every Day repo, I had
        yet to
        dip into system (browser) tests. This particular problem could only be caught by such tests.</p>
      <p>What I discovered was all of the problems were with three forms that were supposed to be redirecting to <a
          href="https://doevery.day/bjhess">the page that shows a user</a>: login, sign up, and edit profile. Each of
        these
        forms were just HTML requests, but Turbo Drive takes over and submits all of these forms as the format
        TURBO_STREAM.
        In this case I had two views for the users/show page: <code>show.html.erb</code> and
        <code>show.turbo_stream.erb</code>. At some point in those aforementioned upgrades to Rails/Turbo had become
        more
        strict and no longer understood these basic form-redirects as HTML formats. TURBO_STREAM in, TURBO_STREAM out.
      </p>
      <p>The first step was to <a href="/blog/2023/rails-system-tests-with-safari/">rediscover how to write browser
          tests</a>.
        This is because my past self incessantly reminds me to <a
          href="https://techtime.getharvest.com/blog/find-bugs-once-and-the-joy-of-bug-fixing">find bugs once</a>.</p>
      <p>Once tests were working, I went on a deep Duck Duck Go excursion trying to figure out why Rails was doing this
        to me.
        After a couple of hours of searching and troubleshooting I discovered that Rails now needs you to be <a
          href="https://discuss.hotwired.dev/t/opting-out-of-stream-responses-on-a-per-form-basis/2467/3">explicit about
          leaving Turbo Drive</a> with <a
          href="https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails#navigate-with-turbo-drive"><code>data-turbo=&quot;false&quot;</code></a>.
        Suddenly tests were passing, both automated and clicky.</p>
      <p>Hopefully over the next year or so this blog post pops up for anyone who is looking to fix the same problem.
