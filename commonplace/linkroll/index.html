      <h2 id="sites">Sites</h2>

      <p>I am <em>not</em> a designer. While I appreciate pretty, readable, useable, and lightweight (I love
        lightweight), I am not a designer. Well-designed, beautiful places on the web do inspire me. While some of these
        sites may have a blog, I had to make a special place to call out the whole package:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Lynn Fisher&rsquo;s amazingly-named <a href="https://lynnandtonic.com">lynnandtonic.com</a>. Not only is the
          site you&rsquo;ve clicked to amazing, <a href="https://lynnandtonic.com/archive/">she redesigns it every
            year</a> â€“ and you can browse past designs!</li>
        <li>As I write this I&rsquo;ve spent a good hour browsing <a href="https://leihu.com">James A.
            Mathias</a>&rsquo;s
          site. I find it completely fascinating, from the writing to the archives to just the way of it. When I found
          the <a href="https://leihu.com/sitemap">sitemap</a>, my jaw might have actually dropped.</li>
        <li><a href="https://v6.robweychert.com">Rob Weychert</a> hits me in the forehead in two ways: his <a
            href="https://v7.robweychert.com">open talk</a> about site redesigning and his <a
            href="https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2021/10/robtober/">one-off Robtober designs</a>, which he also <a
            href="https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2021/10/robtober-2021-design-notes/">documents</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="inspirations-for-my-site">Inspirations for My Site</h2>

      <p>Credit where credit is due, here are some places that inspired this site.</p>

      <h3 id="blogging-and-writing">Blogging and Writing</h3>

      <p>I have maintained a blog in some form since 2004. Those early days had a fair bit of writing as I interacted
        with blog writers from across the spectrum (I remember many of them being on <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanga">Xanga</a>). I miss those days! I also need to write for my own well
        being, but private journaling has not been a habit I&rsquo;ve been able to maintain long term. It seems I need
        to hit a publish button to get a little dopamine in the mix. Thankfully some folks, unbeknownst to most of them,
        have encouraged me to just jump in and write:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Kev Quirk&rsquo;s <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">#100DaysToOffload</a> smacked me in the face and
          said why not. It even had me playing with using Mastodon as what amounted to a hashtag bank. (His <a
            href="https://kevq.uk">personal site</a> also generally inspires me to create simple, lightweight things to
          share.) As the man says: Just. Write.</li>
        <li>Matt Webb&rsquo;s <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/10/streak">Rules for blogging</a>
          provided many useful blogging attitudes, including my favorite: <a
            href="/2022/01/18/writing-is-a.html">Writing Is a Muscle</a>.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://craigmod.com">Craig Mod</a> and his epic newsletters and projects. I particularly like the
          idea of writing and experiences as projects; things that can have both a begin and, importantly, end date.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.robinsloan.com">Robin Sloan</a> has a wonderful way of telling stories. He also likes
          to work in projects, and he hits the <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/">software
            button</a> sometimes as well.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="documenting-as-a-goal">Documenting as a Goal</h3>

      <p>One thing I know about myself is that I&rsquo;m a list person. In childhood I had lists of my books and my
        baseball cards. I would even scour baseball boxscores every week in <em>Sporting News</em>, making my own lists
        of the achievements therin. In other words, as much as I&rsquo;d like to resist it, I have that human need to
        document (a link should go here because I read that somewhere). These are some places that encourage me to
        pursue this goal:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://colly.com/articles/stream-on">Simon Collison</a>&rsquo;s style of articles with a stream
          alongside them was certainly an inspiration. I&rsquo;m doing it a little differently; at least for now.</li>
        <li><a href="https://kottke.org">kottke.org</a> is the ultimate example of one person absorbing, learning, and
          becoming a filter for the web that I find incredibly valuable. I don&rsquo;t visit Kottke daily, or even
          weekly, but every so often I dive in and discover so many things of interestingness.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.thingelstad.com">Jamie Thinglestad</a>&rsquo;s extensive documentation of his life and
          travels, around the world and around the web, including his newsletter, <a
            href="https://www.thingelstad.com/weekly-thing/">Weekly Thing</a>.</li>
        <li>Extensive book notes that people share on their sites. The most obvious example is Derek Sivers&rsquo;s <a
            href="https://sive.rs/book">Books I&rsquo;ve Read</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="commonplace-commonplace"><a href="/commonplace/">Commonplace</a></h3>

      <p>This idea is drawn from the historical <a
          href="https://thepaperkind.com/2020/08/15/commonplace-book/">commonplace
          book</a>. It is very similar to the simple documenting goal above, but I consider it a sort of
        &ldquo;starring&rdquo; of found things. Some specific websites also helped me collect my thoughts around this
        concept:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hiroki Nagasawa&rsquo;s <a href="https://pixyzehn.com/things_i_like/">Things I Like</a>, which was itself
          inspired by Soroush Khanlou&rsquo;s <a href="https://khanlou.com/love/">Things I Love</a>. &ldquo;[T]hey are
          all things I love to go back and reread or rewatch every few months.&rdquo;</li>
      </ul>
