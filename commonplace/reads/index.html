        Commonplace: Reads
      </h1>
      <p>Books read by year: <a href="/commonplace/reads/2022/">2022</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="essays">Essays</h2>

      <p>These are essays and articles that I try to read annually. In fact I will probably republish them in some web
        form at some point so I know they will never be lost to the ether.</p>

      <p>Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/"><em>In Praise of
            Idleness</em></a> is a foundational piece for me. I am frustrated that the progress and efficiencies of the
        last 100 years have not led to a growth in valuable leisure being an option for most of the world population.
        Particularly in America, we should be able to enjoy a reasonable amount of work while pursuing leisurely
        versions of arts, sciences, and letters. I try to remind myself of this and live into it.</p>

      <p>Scott Adams&rsquo;s <a
          href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html"><em>Career
            Advice</em></a> is good for anyone early in their career journey. Or maybe better said, it&rsquo;s good
        advice if you want to be useful – become very good at two things.</p>

      <h2 id="fiction">Fiction</h2>

      <p>Dan Simmons&rsquo;s <a
          href="https://bookshop.org/books/hyperion-88e88c61-d5bb-470f-9a1c-a7b4088bde28/9780553283686"><em>Hyperion</em></a>
        is a breathtaking sci-fi work. The thing will bring you horrors and tears in equal measure.</p>

      <p>Leif Enger&rsquo;s <a
          href="https://bookshop.org/books/peace-like-a-river-9780061457876/9780802139252"><em>Peace Like
            a River</em></a> depicts a search for a brother that leads to some of the most beautiful final chapters I
        recall reading.</p>

      <p>John Scalzi&rsquo;s <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/old-man-s-war/9780765348272"><em>Old Man&rsquo;s
            War</em></a>
        crashed onto the scene with a fresh sci-fi style combining humor with smarts. I was completely enamored with the
        whole book and as such I have basically read all of Scalzi&rsquo;s books thus far. None have approached this
        debut for me, but I am thankful for the hours and hours of entertainment Scalzi has provided.</p>

      <p>David James Duncan&rsquo;s <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-brothers-k/9780553378498"><em>The Brothers
            K</em></a> was recommended to me by a friend. He was certain I would enjoy it. I was not prepared for the
        epic tale woven through these pages. This was the first, and maybe the only, Epic Great American Folktale sort
        of book that I&rsquo;ve read. It is truly a journey.</p>

      <p>Viet Thanh Nguyen&rsquo;s <a
          href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-sympathizer-a-novel-pulitzer-prize-for-fiction/9780802124944"><em>The
            Sympathizer</em></a> tells a fascinating story from the other side of the Vietnam war and its aftermath.</p>

      <p>Anthony Doerr&rsquo;s <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/all-the-light-we-cannot-see/9781501173219"><em>All
            the
            Light We Cannot See</em></a> is a beautiful, moving story set around France and Germany around WWII.</p>

      <p>Hugh Howey&rsquo;s indie darling, <a
          href="https://bookshop.org/books/wool-9781476733951/9780358447849"><em>Wool</em></a>, grabbed me by the collar
        and plopped me into this dystopian world whose pages I could not stop turning.</p>

      <h2 id="non-fiction">Non-Fiction</h2>

      <p>Tim O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s <a
          href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-things-they-carried-9780833574862/9780618706419"><em>The Things They
            Carried</em></a> is a powerfully written meditation on war and its mental impact.</p>

      <p>Jesmyn Ward&rsquo;s <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/men-we-reaped-a-memoir/9781608197651"><em>Men We
            Reaped: A Memoir</em></a> is wrestling out loud with the deaths of five young men in her life The reader is
        confronted with harsh realities that others are simply not allowed to ignore.</p>

      <p>Douglas Adams&rsquo;s <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/last-chance-to-see/9780345371980"><em>Last Chance to
            See</em></a> places the author&rsquo;s legendary humor alongside tales of endangered animals. It is an
        engaging, if saddening, story. The <a href="https://www.markcarwardine.com/last-chance-to-see.html">follow up
          book and BBC series</a> are worthy reads as well.</p>

      <p>Richard Feynman&rsquo;s <a
          href="https://bookshop.org/books/surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman-adventures-of-a-curious-character-9780393355628/9780393355628"><em>Surely
            You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!</em></a> was a book that took me years to finally pick up. What follows is
        the conclusion to the <a href="http://bjhess.com/blog/feynman/">little bit I wrote about the book</a>… My
        favorite lesson of the entire book was what I’ll call Feynman’s Law of Play. <a
          href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7papZR4oVssC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=surely%20you%27re%20joking%20mr.%20feynman&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">This
          page</a> covers it nicely. Feynman found an interesting problem, he studied it, he explained it. It wasn’t
        directly important at all. But it led to something. It was interesting to him and it led to bigger, more
        profound discoveries. Nobel Prize-worthy discoveries.</p>

      <p>Jon Krakauer&rsquo;s <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/into-the-wild/9780385486804"><em>Into the
            Wild</em></a> is an unforgettable story exploring the reasons why a young man pushed himself dangerously
        into the Alaskan wilderness. Expertly written.</p>

      <p>Ta-Nehisi Coates&rsquo;s <a
          href="https://bookshop.org/books/between-the-world-and-me/9780812993547"><em>Between the
            World and Me</em></a> is a beautifully written, challenging work explaining to me a world view that I could
        not myself discover.</p>

      <h2 id="educational">Educational</h2>

      <p>Derek Sivers&rsquo;s <a href="https://sive.rs/n"><em>Hell Yeah or No</em></a> collects essays that convinced me
        to say yes to less, and to look for the things that make me go &ldquo;Hell yeah!&rdquo;</p>

      <h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>

      <p>Danez Smith&rsquo;s <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/don-t-call-us-dead-poems/9781555977856"><em>Don&rsquo;t
            Call Us Dead</em></a> brought an experience to me, viscerally, that I simply could not have myself. Watching
        them read their poems elevates their art even further.</p>
