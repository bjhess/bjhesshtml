<B><FONT SIZE=6><P ALIGN="CENTER">The State of the Pipestone-Jasper Band Program</P>
</FONT><U><P>1. The state of the band program today</P>
</B></U><P>Thousands of students have participated in the Pipestone and Pipestone-Jasper band programs over the years. Several of these students have come to realize that there is a problem with this program. Funding and staffing has dwindled for the band program in recent years as compared to not only other programs within the school district, but also compared to other schools within the region. It is of great important to these alumni, the current student body, and the communities surrounding and including Pipestone that the band program within Pipestone-Jasper High and Middle Schools not be allowed to deteriorate. </P>

<B><U><LI>The Junior High band</LI>
</B></U><P>In the past, Pipestone High school had an adequate Junior High band program. One director, who also led every band at all other levels of schooling, ran this program. A single director assisted him. This assistant gave lessons and helped when he was asked to be of service. </P>
<P>Lessons were given on a regular basis at this time. The head director, assistant director, and any student directors that were currently training at Pipestone taught these lessons. This was hardly an adequate staff, but they were given ample time in which to help the students become better aquatinted with their instruments. Students were given a lesson that lasted one-half hour.</P>
<P>Currently, the Junior High band system is split between two directors (5<SUP>th</SUP>-8<SUP>th</SUP> grades). One of these directors is also responsible for the High School band program. Again, staffing is not ideal, but workable. However, hardly any support is given for musical lessons. This is the real problem that the Junior High band program, and ultimately the Senior High band program, is seeing. Students are averaging eight-minute lessons. This is due to a lack of cooperation from faculty and administration. It is reported that in some cases, students are released late from classes based upon encouragement by administration. </P>
<I><P>Compare this with past lesson times…</P>
</I><P>One more important aspect of a student's training in instrumental music is playing his/her instrument with other people. This is accomplished in a full-band setting. Currently, directors are forced to cram rehearsals into minimal time frames. Some periods are shared with the choir. As little as half and hour is given for full-band rehearsal. After students retrieve, assemble, disassemble, and put away their horns, there is only about twenty minutes left for rehearsal time. Anyone who has participated in a musical group can attest that twenty minutes is hardly enough time to run through music, let alone rehearse it. Running through music is not a learning process. If anythinig, it is detrimental to the learning process.</P>
<I><P>Compare this with past rehearsal times…</P>
</I><P>It appears that the school as an entity does not realize how important these lessons are. Students are not given lessons after their eighth grade year. This means that all habits and methods that a student will use for the rest of their high school playing career are generally learned in the Junior High setting. It becomes painfully obvious that if the correct habits are not learned in Junior High, they will be unlikely to be learned in Senior High, and thus the overall High School level band program will be greatly damaged.</P>
<P>The existence of band programs in the Pipestone-Jasper school district makes it apparent that the district believes these programs are beneficial, academic, and character building activities. The alumni of the district, and the band programs, challenge you to explain why these programs have been considered second tier in the psyche of the school. </P>
<P>An administration would not send a student into College Preparatory English without first requiring him/her to take a grammar class. An administration would not ask a student to do well in Precalculus when he/she had not even been exposed to Algebra. Why would an administration ask a student to represent Pipestone and surrounding communities by playing in a state-renowned band program without offering him/her the proper training?</P>
<B><U><LI>The Senior High band</LI>
</B></U><P>The Senior High band's success is in direct relationship to the state of the Junior High band. As the Junior High band program deteriorates, the Senior High program will also digress. Certainly this effect is not immediate. The power of tradition can only last so long. Students will not always remember that Pipestone-Jasper had a powerful band program. That is why it is so important to keep a strong foundation in place at all times. Why is it important to keep the Pipestone-Jasper Senior High band program strong and dynamic? </P>
<B><U><P>1.2.1 Percentage of students in the band</P>
</B></U><P>It is a <U>nationally known fact</U> that a large percentage of high school students participate in the Pipestone-Jasper band program. This is due to the outstanding success of the program. The band participates and performs at a higher level than bands that come from schools up to five times Pipestone-Jasper's size. This is a significant accomplishment. </P>
<P>It is important to keep this program strong due to the large number of students that participate in this activity. Not only is it important to keep the program <U>at least</U> as successful as it has been, but to keep it growing and improving. If the administration and faculty offer support for the program to grow, than the participating student body will work towards these improvements.</P>
<B><U><P>1.2.2 Number of students listing band as their only activity</P>
</B></U><P>A simple glance at several Pipestone-Jasper yearbooks will show even more reason to keep the Pipestone-Jasper band program strong. There are many students in these yearbooks that only participate in one activity, the band. The feeling of community and support that comes from this program draws students to it. It would be a sad state of affairs if funding and support continued to be cut for the one program in the school that supports and includes the most students in it. A program where every student is a "starter" and every student is vital to the success of the whole.</P>
<B><U><LI>Staffing</LI></OL>
</OL>

</B></U><P>A secondary need for the Pipestone-Jasper band program is that of staffing. When comparing the staff of the band program to other schools, the differences are obvious. The minimal need of the program is that of an Assistant Director. One who is dedicated to helping the High School band director and also take over the direction of one other band? </P>
<P>When it comes to marching band season, Pipestone-Jasper's understaffing is evident. Those that do work to help the marching band get paid minimally. It is approximated that of the three comparable bands in the state, Pipestone-Jasper is budgeted several thousand dollars less for a marching band staff. It should not be considered a dependable resource to expect Pipestone-Jasper alumni to work on the staff for near volunteer wage. </P>
