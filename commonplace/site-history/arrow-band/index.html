		Pipestone-Jasper finished out their year with a performance that many would deem the best of the year in a strong effort at the Quad State marching band competition in Vermillion, South Dakota, this past weekend. Although the Arrows did not place first overall, they showed that they are truly a top tier band in beating all but one competitor in this huge competition.
		<br><br>
		The year can certainly be looked on as a success, especially considering all of the changes that have taken place. A veteran director left with the love of the community in his hand, and a new director came in and showed that he was truly meant to be back home in Pipestone. Congratulations to all the kids and Mr. Dan Stout for an outstanding year!
		<br><br>
		I would also like to apologize for the sporadic updates these past few weeks. The Brookings-Eden Prairie competition weekend was not something that would have been fun to report on. I did not feel the need to get any more political on this website than is already happening in the guestbook. :-) And of course, the college schedule keeps me busy.

		If you would like to see what changes have been made to the website,
		click the "New" link up above. How about reading up on what shows Pipestone-Jasper has
		done in the past and what they plan to do in the future. Click on "Shows" and find out.
		Some pictures are available to look at and hopefully video and audio will follow soon.
		Also, please make your browser as large as possible when viewing this site.

		The Pipestone-Jasper Marching Band has built a history and reputation as one of the 
		best in the upper midwest. This comes from the excitement planted into each annual field 		show. The Arrows are not afraid to try something new and set the standard for high
		school bands in the area. The drive that pushes the Arrows to succeed is not
		necessarily for awards and honors, but more for the pride in the organization. Every
		Pipestone-Jasper Marching Band member is expected to give his/her best. The crowd's
		response is usually reward enough for the hard work that has been done during the 
		summer and fall.
