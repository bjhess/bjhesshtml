    I feel very empty today. My heart is saddened by something my mind
    cannot--nor wants--to understand.
    <br><br>
    I know God's workings are oftentimes shrouded in mystery. I'll leave it at
    that and let the real craftsmen of His word help us understand that
    wisdom. But I think we all need to find comfort in prayer to get us
    through this loss of our son, brother and friend Chad Bloemendaal.
    <br><br>
    My prayers go out to some very dear people.
    <br><br>
    To Paul and LuAnn: I cannot fathom your pain. I have no answers. I admire
    you both and am firm in the belief that your strength will persevere.
    Those moments of glory that Chad captured were nurtured by the strength
    you instilled in him and will forever burn vivid in my mind. I feel it an
    honor that I was able to share in them with you.
    <br><br>

    To Mike and Melissa: I know you both and am deeply grieved by the loss of
    your brother. I've always appreciated the unbashful way you accepted a
    stranger, Mike, and made him feel like one of the crowd with your
    good-natured humor. Melissa, whenever there was a sporting event involving
    Chad, you were there too. Your support must have been invaluable to him.
    As Chad talked to a group of well-wishers Friday night following his Arrow
    wrestling Hall of Fame induction, I noticed how you kindly offered to
    relieve him of the cumbersome plaque he was holding and carefully took it
    to the area your family was sitting in. They might have seemed like little
    things at the time, but I'm sure in the big picture they were cherished.
    <br><br>
    To the grandparents, uncles and aunts of Chad: I know most of you were
    there on that special night of March 2 of last year when Chad placed third
    in the state wrestling tournament and--after a warm embrace from his
    dad--was group hugged by you all. I'm sure that ranked as the crowning
    moment for all the years Chad participated in athletics--maybe it was even
    the pinnacle of his life.
    <br><br>
    To all of Chad's friends, coaches, teachers and all of the other
    individuals who had an impact on his life: Like me, you mourn and wonder
    why. Why does this happen to a gifted 19-year-old with his whole life in
    front of him? This same question has jabbed at me ever since I heard of
    the news of the accident.
    <br><br>
    I prefer to drift back to the memories.
    <br><br>
    Covering high school sports for a living has put me in close contact with
    a number of individuals on the threshold of adulthood. For the most part,
    I take snapshots of their lives. Through words and photos, my aim is to
    give the reading populace a tangible image of these student athletes
    competing in the games they love to play.
    <br><br>
    I would be remiss in trying to comment on all the segments of Chad
    Bloemendaal's life, but in the arena of sports, we had a rapport that I
    was fond of.
    <br><br>
    He was a tough kid, a rough-hewn type that seemed to scratch and claw for
    everything that he got. And he got a lot. I remember trying to capture
    that perception on paper two years ago by penning him with the nickname
    "The Outlaw." He helped me out in coming up with that one by wearing a
    black cowboy hat during warmups prior to a home wrestling meet with
    Worthington.
    <br><br>
    Bloomy was an emotional wrestler who took great pride in his exploits on
    the mat. Only once was he beaten by an opponent from a grade lower than
    him and Chad never surrendered a pin in the five years he wrestled
    varsity.
    <br><br>
    That kind of determination and hard work flourished into a spectacular
    career. With 99 wins, Chad is the fifth winningest Arrow wrestler of all
    time. He was named all-Southwest Conference at his weight in both 1994 and
    1996. Advancing out of sub-section for two successive years, Chad finished
    fourth in Section 3A as a 171-pound sophomore and fifth as a junior when
    he began competing at 189 pounds.
    <br><br>
    A powerful upper-body worker who would master the arm-drag move and the
    headlock, Chad had his most memorable wrestling season as a senior last
    year. After sitting out the first third of the year because he
    self-admittedly felt burned-out by the sport, Chad quickly had the fire
    rekindled inside by watching a few matches and rejoined the team. A crowd
    favorite at home, he climbed back in the saddle and put together a 15-1
    record through the regular season. that made him the third-highest point
    getter on the year for the Arrows behind Steve Saxlund and Dustin
    Darveaux.
    <br><br>
    It got better at sectionals. It was at that tournament in Jackson that
    Chad displayed his way of expressing school spirit by opting for a hairdo
    that left only a cut-out arrow symbol. It was an appropriate gesture since
    he was soaring, winning five matches in a row that culminated in a
    thrilling overtime championship victory that sent him to the state
    tournament for the first time.
    <br><br>
    He wouldn't be alone in St. Paul. Saxlund and Darveaux would join him for
    the anticipated tournament that would turn out to be a real gem and
    classic send-off for P-J coach Dick Saxlund, whose retirement announcement
    following state would cap off a 32-year coaching career with the Arrows.
    <br><br>
    In many ways, the state showcase event in the Civic Center would serve as
    a mini-capsule for Bloomy's prep career. It showed that he could be down,
    but certainly not out.
    <br><br>
    <img src="win.jpg" align="left" height=250 width=166>
    The chasm that Chad stumbled into happened on the very first day when he
    dropped a two-point loss in the second round. But there were always the
    wrestlebacks and having vowed to himself that he didn't want to exit his
    senior year empty-handed, Chad showed the firmness of his mettle by wining
    four matches in a row to place third at 189. By finishing with the bronze
    medal draped around his neck, Chad earned the distinction of being named
    an all-state selection.
    <br><br>
    By battling back the way he did, Chad made it a magical state tournament
    that will go down in history. Combined with Steve Saxlund's state
    championship and Darveaux's runner-up placing, it marked the first time an
    Arrow team had three placewinners, let alone a 1-2-3 finish.
    <br><br>
    I will never forget those times. The way he supercharged a young Darveaux
    with his booming voice and made-to-order pep chats on the practice mats in
    the bowels of the mammoth stadium. He did this all while feigning the
    massive pressure he must have felt being applied to his own shoulders.
    <br><br>
    The glory times were the best. The pump of the fist he gave in recognition
    to his throng of supporters and his searching out of his father following
    the 5-0 win over Jesse Pates of Paynesville that ensured the third-place
    finish. When I closed my eyes and asked the Lord to protect him when I
    first heard of the tragedy, that's the picture that came to me.
    <br><br>
    It's the duty of a parent to provide a guiding light for their children.
    One extra layer Paul Bloemendaal gave to Chad was the opportunity to hone
    his athletic talents at an early age. Logging all those miles in the
    family sedan to camps and clinics created a strong bond between father and
    son. In my eyes, wrestling was that bond.
    <br><br>
    Just go watch the Little Arrows youth wrestling team compete and you'll
    see the early formations of that bond between child and parent. Dick and
    Steve Saxlund did it on a much more noticeable plane since they added the
    dual relationship of player/coach to the mix, but ask anyone associated
    with the Arrow wrestling program and they'll tell you there was no
    mistaking the connection Chad and Paul shared.
    <br><br>
    What's still surreal to me was that Paul and I had a long talk about Chad
    in the Arrow gym prior to Friday night's Hall of Fame ceremony. We
    discussed how Chad, like many freshman, was finding the academic
    requirements of college much more demanding than high school and was
    working hard in an effort to bring his grades up at Augsburg. he told me
    that it took about two weeks for Chad to realize that college football
    wasn't always played neatly between the rules and that even in practice
    things turned in to an every-man-for-himself showdown. Bloomy stuck it out
    and that impressed the Auggie coaches so much that, thinking there must be
    more like him back home, told Chad it was his special assignment to
    recruit John DeKam to their campus for next year's grid season.
    <br><br>
    Then there was the information Paul relayed about Chad's practice partner
    in the Auggies' wrestling room. Dan Lewandowski, a multiple all-American
    at 190 pounds, often left Chad battered and bruised at the end of one of
    their sparring sessions. But as was his form, Bloomy always went back for
    more.
    <br><br>
    Saying Paul Bloemendaal was proud of his son would be an understatement.
    The casual observer might not have made this connection early in Chad's
    high school career when they watched as the father always seemed to get up
    and leave the gym just as his son was about to stride to the mat. But
    Paul wasn't gone. He'd find some far-off corner or side doors to peek
    through, but he'd be watching. He tamed hi excitable habits down to a
    manageable degree as Chad grew into an upperclassman and again found a
    seat close to the action, but there was no mistaking that jump for joy
    after a win or the consoling rub of the neck after a loss that was a true
    giveaway that this was indeed dad.
    <br><br>
    I think to all of the people that this fly on the wall spotted teaching,
    learning and laughing with Bloomy and I hope that once the grieving
    process is over, that they can carry with them the spirit of his
    inspiration and resiliency.
    <br><br>
    <img src="look.jpg" align="right" height=250 width=262>
    My thoughts turn to the Saxlunds--Dick and Steve--who spent countless
    hours with Bloomy. Steve and Chad might not have spent a lot of time
    together away from their sporting venues, but they shared a distinct
    affinity on them. Both were the same age. Both chose the same sports and
    matured in those programs together. In their senior years, Steve and Chad
    both manned a defensive end position and the two shared the honor of being
    co-captains for the team.
    <br><br>
    Before Bloomy had his daily run-ins with Lewandowski, he had tough
    wrestling partners in Lance Miller and Darveaux. They say that when you
    drill with the best, you become the best. And that list of wrestlers
    certainly backs that statement up.
    <br><br>
    I think of the Arrow football coaches who never had a bad word to say of
    Bloomy. Head coach Tim Bjorge and assistants Chuck Schroyer, Scott Rudie
    and Jamie Sumption all worked closely with Chad and must now be feeling a
    great loss.
    <br><br>
    And I think of all of his teammates. Especially wrestling pal Justin
    Stratman, who could be seen being congratulated by Bloomy after a dramatic
    win Friday night during P-J's triangular, and football linemates Lance
    Niehus, Mark Roelfsema, Jason Caskey, Matt Biever, Darveaux, Nathan
    Ossenfort, Andrew Farmer, Brad Hiniker and Brad Dethmers. They shared the
    unity of the trenches.
    <br><br>
    To Chad's new teammates and friends at Augsburg, many of whom were on hand
    at the funeral that took place on the day that this paper was published or
    who will attend a memorial service on campus early next week. You were
    just beginning to know Bloomy. He was a good one.
    <br><br>
    And finally, one person I really extend my heart out to is Matt
    DeSchepper. Hootie and Bloomy were the best of friends, inseparable, it
    seemed, during their high school days. Matt, I convey my sympathy to you.
    Find solace in the many friends that I know are there for you now. Goodbye
    No. 52. We'll miss you.
