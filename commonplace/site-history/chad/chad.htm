"Chad, it's Hootie. I remember talking to you as if it were the last
Friday night you were with me and we went Cosmic bowling and
you would rub that damn bald head of yours and say,"Magic head." And all
that Mountain Dew we drank and you just learned to snap the Mountain Dew
bottle caps aroud someone's house and she got so pissed off at you. But
you never really cared. That is what I liked the most about you, Blowfish.
Dude, this page they made for you is the shit, dude. One thing I'll
remember the most is the day I asked you who would carry the other to
the 6 foot hole and do you remember what you said to me? Well I tell
everyone the truth. You said, "I (Blowfish) would carry you
(Hootie) to the hole first because you do the most stupid and most crazy
things in the whole world." Chad, you and me never got to go sledding that
Saturday, did we? Dude, if you really want to know what the most horrible
thing in the whole world is. Well, it's carrying your best friend to his
final resting spot when he said he will be the one carrying you. Well, 
Dude, got to go. I will never forget you BLOWFISH, and see you when it is
my turn. Dude, me and Swens made a wrestling award for you to help all
of us down here remember you. See you #52." - your best friend, Matt
DeSchepper aka HOOTIE.<br><br>
"Chad, you have been out of my life for a while and there isn't a day that
goes by that I don't think about you and think about how much I miss you!
You have been a very important person in my life. More than anybody will
ever know. You always knew how to make me smile and give me a big 'Chad
hug' or even advice about anything and I love you for that. The one thing
I really appreciated and will miss is the fact that you were always
strong and supported me when I needed you most. While you laid in that
hospital bed I was the strong one for you. I held your hand and made sure you 
knew that I wanted to be strong for you no matter what happened. I have
tried to carry that on, but it's hard when my best friend who I love very
much isn't here to make me smile or just make me feel special. I have
some wonderful memories of you from puking in first grade to the junior
and senior class parties to all the visits you surprised me with in the
first year of college. I will never forget any of the memories shared
with you or how important you are to me. I just want you to know that I
think about you everyday and I miss and love you with all of my heart." -
Love Always, Heidi<br><br>
"I don't know if you know me, but I hope Chad told you about me.  I knew
Chad when I became a wrestling cheerleader in 9th grade.  I'm Molly Burns.
For the 2 years of being a wrestling cheerleader Chad and I grew to be good
friends.  I always wanted it to be more than friends, but it never worked
out. When I heard that Chad had died, I cried during my choir class and
was miserable the rest of the day.  Although we never spent much time 
together, there were moments that I will never forget.  It didn't hit me, 
until 2 weeks later when I saw, long time friend, Becky White, that I 
started crying in the hallway at a speeck tourney. He meant so much to me. 
I can clearly say he was and always will be the nicest guy to me from 
Pipestone. I know he's in a better place, but every now and then I wish I
could've seen him one last time. We didn't have much, but I'm glad for the
time we shared together. I'm truly sorry for all the others affected by
the loss of Chad." - Molly Burns<br><br>
"Chad thanks for all the great times in Spanish when you teased me about
Jeremy. You could always make me laugh no matter how bad of a mood I was
in. Thank you so much for the memories." - Maritta Rozeboom<br><br>
"i wasn't in Chad's class, i never knew him as well as his classmates. it
sucks that i got to know a really great guy after his life was lost. my
brother was in his class, and they were friends. i heard all about the
stories from shooting fireworks, and drinking (mt dew) in the jasper
quarry, to the swimming party with nate and noel. i knew chad as more than
a face because he would come with my brother to sioux falls and party with
us on occasional weekends while they were still in high school. everything
i have heard about what people remember about chad is exactly what i remember 
about him from my one year in high school with him, and the few times he
was at augie. his smile, his sense of humor, his carefree yet caring
personality. he was very charismatic. he became my friend the moment i
started talking to him. some people appeal to you, and some people appeal
to other people. chad was admired by everyone. although i didnt know chad
that well, the grief of all of you touched me deeply. his class came
together as one friend mourning at the loss of another. i hurt because i
could see the pain of all of you. for the first time in my life i saw my
brother cry (sorry ding). these are just signs of how much chad was loved,
and admired. my heart goes out to all of the P/J class of 96, chad's
family and friends. jake, you're right we take life for granted. Chad, i
wish i would have told you when you were alive, but i know your're still
with us all, thanx for being my friend!" -derek allmendinger<br><br> 
"Chad, you have set an example to so many people in this world, you owe
nothing more to anybody. Take care of yourself, and watch over those of us
still down here. Save me a spot at the title, because you know I'm going
to come looking for you. Don't get too fat, and keep in practice so I
won't have to embarass you when we wrestle. Always remember the good
times." -Lance Miller<br><br> 
"I remember Chad all the way back to my elementary years.  When you think
about it, it's only been 10 years, but a lot has been accomplished and a
lot of memories have been made in that time.  My aunt used to live next
door to Chad and I remember running to the park behind Erickson's to
play. He would push me on the swings and twirl me on the other
"toys."  Then it got to be our high school days and I began cheering.
Yes, I sure did get a lot of crap from Chad and the rest of his family
in that time. I was constantly borrowing my pillow to him and I remember
the look of determination every single time he was about to wrestle.  No
one could match the looks of pride his parents shared and the way that
his dad would cheer and encourage and jump and move around while he
wrestled.  Chad was very supported by his friends and family and it was
obvious how much he was loved, but it always bothers me to wonder if he
realized how much people looked up to him.  It really is unfortunate
that it takes something so tragic for someone to acknowledge how much
they care for their peers.  It never failed that I could go to Senior
Math 2nd hour in the worst mood and he could place a perm-a-grin on my
face in a matter of seconds.  Then, there's all the times we partied
together. He could dance and didn't care at all about what people
thought.  He was always to be admired.  It is so hard to accept that
Chad was back to receive awards in his honor and this had to happen.  I
hope everyone is strong and can pray daily for his well-being and that of
his family.  Chad is now able to watch each and every one of us and I know
he knows that we are with him!  We love you Chad!" -Angie Gorter<br><br>
"I have many memories of Chad.....Most of them, I see the same smiling
face, in the weight room, in tenth grade when he and I were gym helpers
together, in Spanish class, or just in the hallway. When I think of him
that is what I see, the smiling face, and of course the bald head. I
could mention all the memories I have of Chad, but that would take
infinity. I think and I hope that a part of Chad will always be with me.
He always knew how to have a good time. And even though some of us may
not have done things the way he did, he was still a great guy, and
good friend to whoever needed it. My heart goes out to his family and even
though he is no longer gracing us with his presence here on earth, may he
live on forever in our hearts....in our thoughts....and in our soul."
-Tom Ness<br><br>
"I will always remember Chad as my first boyfriend... that's right, he
was my boyfriend from the spring of fourth grade to the fall of fifth
grade.  Even though it wasn't a deep relationship (of course), it's a
great memory to have of Chad.  I really regret to say that I took Chad
for granted in high school.  I guess I just assumed he'd always be
here... just like lunchtime or math class.  I know that's terrible, but
to me Chad was that tall, red-haired guy whose locker was next to mine
throughout high school.  He was a built-in part of my life.  Though we
were never close, we respected each other for our individual interests
and talents.  I watched him wrestle for many years and cheered him on
from the sidelines.  Even from a distance, I could feel Chad's victories
and defeats.  I know what a great guy he was just by talking to him once
in awhile and seeing him interact with others, and I will always regret
that I never took the opportunity to get to know him better.  Chad, I'm
sorry.  Maybe we can be close friends in the next world." -Laura
Bobendrier<br><br>
"Chad was a very special person to me.  Whenever I would see him he would
have a huge smile on his face and he would always have something funny to
say. I will cherish those memories of the pageant, at D.K. buying all
those $1.07 quart-size Mountain Dews (he would always tip me $.05) :)
all those letters back and forth from basic training telling me how homesick
he was, and the senior class party when he was with an unnamed person in
the back of his bronco. Thanks, Chad, for all of those memories--your
friendship will forever be remembered." -Jesse Cox<br><br>
"I will always remember Chad for his excitement about everything.  He
loved life and lived it to the fullist.  Chad was a very special person,
his personality was very friendly and out going,  and I always have and
always will admire his determination.  Hopefully all of these qualities
can be an inspiration to all of us." -Amy Scotting<br><br>
"Chad could always make anybody laugh, he had the greatest jokes and stories.
He was the fun loving, party-going type of guy.  I think of times like when
we were at Stacy Peters house, and he and Nate Geske were swimming in their
underwear, he had on these old briefs, they were almost yellow they were so
old. Then i think of his funny stories when we were hanging out drinking,
uhh, pop, like mountain dew and water.  The times we hung out at the Jasper
quarry, on gravel roads, at school, on the wrestling bus, in the football
locker room, the runs to and from the locker room, and during practice.
When it was game time, there weren't many who were more focused than Chad.
For those of you in physics class, chad always had something entertaining to
say or do, and i'm sure he was like that in almost all his classes.  I'll
miss him greatly, and I know I'm not the only one.  #52, I'll miss you." 
-Noel Krueger<br><br>
"Chad, you gave me some great memories throughout the years.  I'll never
forget the time that you almost threw me into the water at pageant, the
movie Father of the Bride, and you and Hootie showing off every day at
the swimming pool.  You gave the best hugs in the world and were one of
the best friends that I had.  Thanks for the memories.  We'll never
forget you!" -Carisa Meulebroeck<br><br>
"I'll never forget you, Chad. We had a lot of fun in College Prep. We 
all miss you." -Nancy Torkelson<br><br>
"I sat by Chad in Mr. Hutchinson's fifth grade class. We sat in back by 
the windows. I remember thinking,'that guy has re-e-ed hair.' Now I 
have two little brothers with red hair. Chad was just as cheerful in 
fifth grade as he was in high school, which was helpful in long boring  
classes like Physics." -Cara Prunty<br>

A speech given by Scott Jacobson<br>
Topic:  Life<br></font></center>
<br>
<font size=+1>
   What is something that both you and I have and both of us take it for
granted?  The answer to this question is life, and life is something
that should be significant to all of us.  Life has become a little more
significant to me as I have grown up and experienced the loss of a few
friends.  I have gone through two of my classmates funerals.  One when
I was pretty young and wasn't ready to deal with death, and one last
week.  Both were tough on me, but both taught me a little something about
life.<br><br>
   The first funeral was when I was in eighth grade. Dawn, a classmate was
taken from us all.  Dawn didn't realize how significant life was until
it was t0o late.  She committed suicide. The saddest thing about
this is that after taking the overdose of sleeping pills she realized
her life was worth living and tried to call for help, but before she
could dial the numbers or even yell for the help from her family she
passed out.<br><br>
   The day of her funeral was a sad day, but it begun the lesson that I
will continue to learn until the day that I die.  Once you are dead
there is nothing left for you on earth.  Even though Dawn wasn't one of
my closer friends, she was still my friend and I was affected deeply by
her passing away.  My life had a new meaning, I never wanted to die.  I
did not want to put anyone close to me in that kind of pain and
suffering that I felt that day.   Within a year, Dawn was forgotten.  I
would never hear or speak her name again until the day that I
graduated.<br><br>
   The lessons Dawn had begun to teach me in the eighth grade were renewed
last week, but in a completely different way.  Another classmate of
mine was taken from me, but this time it wasn't planned.  Chad was
driving to a friend's house when he was struck by a train.  He did not
see it coming and when he finally did it was too late.  He hit his breaks
and slid on an ice patch onto the tracks and was hit and drug half way
through the town.  The next day, he passed away.<br><br>
   Unlike Dawn, Chad realized how important life was. He had a great life
and lived life to the fullest and he never gave up.   Even the night
before Chad passed away, he refused to give up.  His heart beat 150 beats
per minute trying to compensate for the lack of blood getting to his
brain.  This is more then twice the speed of the average heart rate.
It continued this for six hours.  I could go on and on about all of
the times when the going got tough and Chad refused to quit, but this
can only be a 4-6 minute speech.  Chad did not want to die, but he was
one of those people when asked at the gates of heaven if he had any
regrets would answer without hesitation NO.  I guess this is the
first lesson Chad has taught me.  He has taught me that everyone is
going to die, the only question is do you want to answer that question
with a yes or a no.  Chad taught me to live my life to the fullest and
not to take anything for granted.<br><br>
   Unlike Dawn, Chad never got to say goodbye to his friends and family
for the last time.  He did not know that when he jumped in his car and
started it, he had just seen his parents for the last time.  What if
Chad would have done the unthinkable and told his parents he loved them
or thank them for everything they had done for him.  He probably would
not be dead and you would not be hearing this speech right now. This is
the final and the most important lesson that Chad has taught
me.  A life can be taken in five seconds.  It would have taken Chad five
seconds to tell his parents he loved them.  He would have seen the train
five seconds sooner and would have been able to stop.  In that five
seconds was a life, Chad's life.<br><br>
   The week before the funeral, I vowed that Chad's memory would not be
forgotten like Dawn's was.  We did a number of things; from blowing up a
football picture to give to his parents to painting his football number
near the tracks where he was hit.   But the truth is that eventually
Chad will be forgotten no matter what we do or say.  Like Dawn,  once
forgotten Chad will not be brought up or even remembered  again until a
class reunion down the road.<br><br>
   But these lessons that Chad and Dawn have taught me will last forever
even if there memories do fade away.   I am going to try to live my
life to the fullest and never have any regrets.  Both of them were taken
too soon.  Dawn by choice and Chad by accident.  As much as I hope I
am wrong, both will be forgotten eventually, but the lessons Dawn and
Chad have taught me will last a life time.  However long that may be.<br>

Message written on a card to Chad's family.<br>
The card was signed: Class of 1996<br><br></font></center>
<font size=+1>
Chad has meant a lot to each and everyone of us the class of 1996.  But
there are no two feelings the same among us classmates and friends.  We
all loved Chad for different reasons.  Most of us looked up to him in a
multitude of ways.  Some for his intelligence, Chad was always one of
those few who understood almost any problem put in front of him; Others
admired Chad as a great athlete, not only did Chad excel in football he
was also a great wrestler.  Not many people get a chance to participate
in state for any sport, let alone place in it like Chad did;  Along with
this, Chad was admired by all of his teammates.  We all looked up to him
for his leadership and for his drive.  Chad never gave up. If he was
knocked down he would get right back up and keep fighting until he was
able to succeed.  He was a true sportsman;  Still others loved Chad for
Chad.  He had a winning personality.  He could bring humor to almost any
situation, whether with a funny joke he had heard or one of his many
stories, and nobody could tell a story like Chad;  But if nothing else he
was respected by us all.  There is not one person in the class that we
respected more, he had it all.<br><br>
The one feeling that us classmates do share is the feeling of great
loss.  He was a friend to us all and will be missed by everyone.  But he
will be in all of our hearts forever.<br>

<font size=+1>
As I am gone, I see your tears, but reach down so you won't fear.<br>
Don't think of me as I am gone, I've left my shell, my soul goes on.<br>
We all have marks, I've left mine here, amongst my friends, to laugh
and cheer.<br>
Don't sit around and let time fly, there's life to live so reach the
sky.<br>
Please laugh with joy and smell the flowers, cause crying tears will
pass the hours.<br>
Do all the things that we once did, spread on my light for me my
friends.<br>
Who's to say who must go first, our lives are destined, it's just
re-birth.<br>
God calls his children, when it's time, it seems unfair, for those
left behind.<br>
But, I have not gone, don't hide in my shadow. we've already stepped
through half the battle.<br>
Cause here I will wait, for just you and me, high up in the heavens,
forever will be.<br>
