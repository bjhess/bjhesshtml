				Both sides of the hope and the internet argument are presented on this website. One wonders if the benefits of the internet truly outweigh the faults. Does the internet provide anything that truly improves the human race as a moral and ethical entity?
				<br><br>
				It is important to realize that most information provided on the internet can be had elsewhere. The products and services provided on the internet are rarely necessities. However, the potential of the internet is to greatly improve the human race - allowing people to communicate at a level never before achieved throughout history.
				<br><br>
				It seems that the internet was created out of hope for the future. However, has that hope been bastardized into to something evil? Is the internet being used as a cash machine for the rich to get richer? Has the internet become a tool for convenience and laziness - an escape from humanity? Is the internet on the road to truly become a destroyer of hope?
