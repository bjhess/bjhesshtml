				Many technological people feel that the internet is a means to an end.  Peace and community can be found in the internet.  Certainly there are instances that support this.  There are e-mails consoling and praying for those linked with the Columbine massacre.  There is e-mail correspondence between people in the United States and people in Yugoslavia.
				<br><br>
				Not only has world communication become possible for many more people, but the rate at which that communication takes place has drastically increased.  Previously, a pen pal letter would take several weeks to reach its goal, where an e-mail could take only seconds.  Those that have hoped to travel abroad or learn of a new culture can now "travel" with the simple click of a button.  Innately, man feels for man, no matter what language, color, or religion that the other man is.  Internet technologies allow for man to reach out and actually communicate his feelings to other men throughout the world.

				Initially, it appears that the internet is the ideal carrier of the ultimate hope of the human race.  Proponents argue that it does improve peace and community and will bring peace and community to unprecedented levels.  An example of this world community in action is National Public Radio's <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/kosovo/voices/index.html" target="_new2">Kosovo coverage</a>.
