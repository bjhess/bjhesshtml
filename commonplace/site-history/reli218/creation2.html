				Many people have gained material progress through internet technology.  Although most technologies tend to make humans lose jobs, the internet has actually added millions of jobs to the American market in the 1990's.  This has the social effect of making people happier because they are living in a more stable community.

				The bulk of the wealth from the internet's growth has went to the previously wealthy. However, the internet has also brought new millionaires to light and increased the amount of upper-middleclass Americans. This prosperity in the tech world has helped to bring about one of the most impressive economic eras in America's history. With technology advancing at an exponential rate, there is a strong hope that the economy will only get better with the future.

				A Christian idealist would see this as a great opportunity to rid America of poverty and homelessness. With more and more people becoming millionaires, there is an opportunity to give like never before - not only helping American poor, but the impoverished of the entire world. The hope inspired by this economic boom makes this thought possible even in its idealistic nature.
