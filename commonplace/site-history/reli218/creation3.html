				It is often conteded that computers are the key to American scholarship improving on the world scale. That is an ironically uneducated statement. Computers do not teach students, teachers do. Computers can only act as a catalyst to student's learning, much like a library or learning environment. Certainly the best environment possible should be given to students. <a href="http://www.dictionary.com" target="_new2">Dictionary.com</a> is a good example of computers giving students hope.

				Students doing research projects and papers have begun using the internet as a vast resource for information. Libraries are connected to each other allowing students to search expansive databases for books, periodicals, papers, etc. These resources make research easier that it ever has been before. The strong push to wire American schools gives a hope that internet resources will be even better in the future.
