				The internet provides a ton of information to the smart browser. One can search the web for statistics that support research or theories. The ability to search through this information is a great asset. 
				<br><br>
				A frequently used internet functionality is customized news. Websites like <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_new2">Yahoo!</a> allow customized news services. These services give the user the ability to instantly receive news about any world, national, or local matter of major importance. News gateways also allow users to filter out any unwanted news - much more convenient than the evening news on TV.

				This increased news service allows the world community to grow stronger - a real-life version of the saying "it's a small world." Articles written by all kinds of individuals are available, such as this <a href="http://www.dimensional.com/~johnston/" target="_new2">commentary</a> by Columbine High School student Zach Johnston. Stories of both pain and hope arising from pain are available from around the world. Instant news allows the user to keep up with happenings of the world - feeling almost as if he is part of the events.
