				Men inherently have hopes. These hopes drive them to create things that work towards a realization of their dreams.  The internet was created on a military basis, but has since conformed to the hopes of its current proponents. In essence, the internet was created out of hope - a hope for the betterment of man. The internet has increased economic prosperity in the United States by spawning hundreds of new companies providing thousands of new jobs. Ideally, the internet will increase activity in social communities, allowing more free time that is gained from the convenience of the internet. Also, new global communities will be created due to the ease of communication which the internet provides. Education will be pushed to its greatest efficiency ever because of the added internet information database that has been created world-wide.
