				Many believe that the internet is destroying hope for every second that it exists. Social and economic bounds grow larger and larger as the internet pushes its mechanical body against our precious reality. The little hope that is provided by the internet is difficult to balance with reality. 
				<br><br>
				Proponents of the internet say it brings hope into communities and improves peace and communication. However, the class divisions that the internet causes are dissuading many from believing that it has anything to do with improving community. In the case of increased divisions, the internet would generally reduce the amount of hope for those who do not have access to it. Hopes for improvement that were so long in the making are being destroyed as yet another technology is brought to help the wealthy "get ahead."

				The seven richest men in the world could abolish <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~sananda/homeless/whu1.html" target="_new2">poverty</a> virtually overnight, if they felt like it.	The average person in a developed nation is 40 times wealthier, and has an income 13 times greater than the average person in a developing country. This privileged quarter of humanity in developed countries also benefits directly from 94% of ALL the world's health care expenditures, from 70% of ALL the world's food grains, from 92% of ALL world industry, and from 89% of ALL the world's education spending. It seems the internet is just one more strike against the impoverished. Meanwhile, more and more technological pioneers are becoming the richest men and women in the world.
