				The state of America, and the world, does not allow for every person to have a computer.  This inequality creates a domino effect.  Those without computers do not have the same informational resources as those that are more fortunate.  Due to this fact, social divisions could become compounded.  The internet has the potential to create even more blatant class divisions.  There is a definite psychological, social, and material fault of the internet.  It targets those that can afford a computer and those school districts that can afford to wire their libraries and computer labs. It is a dangerous situation to be in.

				At the rate that computers and the internet are being accepted, computers will become a status symbol that rivals the traditional literary materialism symbol - the automobile (read <i>The Great Gatsby</i>). The communication and convenience that computers can offer will become yet another dividing point between the well-off and the poor. Anonymous communication is rampant on the internet, and the hope is that rich and poor alike can speak in the same forum as equals. However, the poor have much less connectivity and are much less represented in the cyber-world just as the real world. It seems our internet equality hopes are not looking too bright.
