				Wiring schools will not save them.  This is an important thought.  The Clinton administration has been throwing money at public education in order to help schools get wired.  However, spending money on computers without making other reforms is misguided.  In this case, one hopes that the leaders of this country can see the true needs of its people.  The government appears to be hoping that the internet and computers can correct the lack of responsibility taken by teachers and parents.  In actuality, enhanced teachers' educations and better social morals will improve our children, not necessarily computers.

				Here is a case of computers and the internet stealing hope from where it should be derived, our human race.  The hope placed in these computers will not be actualized.  Failed hope may cause humans to quit hoping entirely, which would be disastrous for the entire human race.
