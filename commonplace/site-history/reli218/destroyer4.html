				The fact that the internet is loaded with information does not mean that it is loaded with knowledge.  For instance, just because you can search the internet for every baseball player with a career .287 batting average doesn't mean that you learned from the internet.  Knowledge often requires the aid of a carrier of wisdom, or in other words, a teacher.  The information overload found on the internet could never be considered a knowledge overload.

				The hopeful man's view of the internet is one of global communication and mountains of useful information, not bytes of pornography and racist garbage.  Not only does one hope for mountains of information, but also useable knowledge.  There is useable knowledge available on the internet, but it is so hard to filter the knowledge from the bulk information - a nigh impossible task. The realization of this hope will be difficult indeed.  How many hopes will be shattered in trying to achieve this goal?
				<br><br>
				The filtering of information would allow for some drastic consequences on human nature. Humans feel for their fellow humans, but with news filtering people would essentially be able to remove all tragic news from their lives. Imagine a future news filter that allows the user to only receive good news. Initially, that sounds like a great deal. However, bad news is essential to define humans as humans. Hope derives out of complications in the flow of the narrative - or in essence, bad news.
