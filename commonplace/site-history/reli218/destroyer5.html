				Opinions ride the internet's electronic waves, causing many to simply plug in ideas to their basic framework of beliefs.  The internet seems to make it even more easy to let someone else formulate opinions for others. Hope should not lie in the opinions and beliefs of others, but be grounded in one's own faith and thoughts.

				One questions if Americans have become lazy in their opinion forming.  This is not to say that Americans do not express their opinions, adamantly at times.  However, one may question how these opinions were arrived at.  Is it because of the latest <a href="http://www.zdnet.com" target="_new2">ZDnet</a> article? Or Dan Rather?  This lack of thought may be attributed to lack of human-to-human communication.  Information is so easy to come by on the internet that people may assume that opinions are gotten and supported in the same way.  Without challenging formulations of thought, how can someone have actual hopes and opinions that are grounded in reality?
				<br><br>
				The internet helps people to change their views daily, on a whim of the latest <a href="http://www.excite.com" target="_new2">Excite</a> article.  It becomes difficult to believe in someone who has such drastic fluctuations in his ideals.  It is hard to believe that the hopes of this person are his own and that he actually has a stake in them.  It must become difficult for that same person to trust in his hopes.  Hope is what drives the human machine, what are we without it?
