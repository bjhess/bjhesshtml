				Many say that the internet is increasing community in the world at a breakneck pace. In actuality, it appears that the internet is only helping to further the gains of wealth seekers and divide the classes even more blatantly than ever. The rich keep getting richer and the poor getting poorer - the internet does not appear to be changing this fact. The hopes of the poor have traditionally been stronger than those of the rich. However, the internet appears to knock the hopes of the poor down, not bring them up. 
				<br><br>
				Some seem to think that the savior of education is technology, computers, and the internet. This seems very far from the truth. The mass amounts of money that have been spent on wiring school in America has stolen from true eduction dollars for teachers. Teachers are in danger of relying on computers to teach children. Parents may feel that buying a computer for their child will replace books, parental guidance, and babysitters. Very few people hope or feel for computers. If our children are taught by computers, how will they learn to feel and hope for their peers?
				<br><br>
				The internet has tons of information, but is there any knowledge. Certainly some exists, but many mistake the mountains information for knowledge. Again, a teacher is in most cases necessary for the acquisition of knowledge. A simple computer screen with information and no thought processes is much more difficult to gain knowledge from than a human being. The filtering of information is also in danger of causing internet browsers to become creators of unfeeling human beings. News and opinions filtered to the user's web browser allow the user to ignore ideas contrary to his own and also ignore news events that bother him.
