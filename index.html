      </div>
      <p> Over the past 20 years I have spent my
        time building software using everything from COBOL to Ruby (most
        of all). I have been fortunate to build a lot of awesome
        software with many amazing people, and that software is being
        used by thousands today. My creative outlets are woodworking,
        cooking, and writing. My brainstorms are about small businesses.
        My primary work is being a husband, dad, brother, son, and
        friend. </p>

        <h2> <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/categories/blog/">Blog</a>
        </h2>
        <p> I have been blogging since 2004. Over time it became a way
          for me to share the things I was learning as I left enterprise
          programming for independent and start-up development. Other
          common topics are general to career and lifestyle. </p>
        <h2> <a href="https://doevery.day">doevery.day</a> </h2>
        <p> My friend Shawn and I put together a website to help us stay
          motivated to do the daily thing we like to do to keep
          ourselves happy. We built it for us to go after creative
          pursuits like drawing and writing. It's a sort of Seinfeld
          calendar with a log. And a little fun built in. </p>
        <h2> <a href="https://www.owatonnaparking.com/">Owatonna
            Parking</a> </h2>
        <p> Parking on the street during the winter can be quite a
          challenge. There are rules that I don't understand, the rules
          are somewhat hard to follow, and my brain gets lost. This
          website makes it simple to load a page and park where it tells
          you to park. </p>
        <h2> <a href="https://www.getharvest.com">Harvest</a> </h2>
        <p> From 2007 to 2019 I was part of an elite team at Harvest
          building the best time tracking and invoicing software on the
          planet. Being part of the team from nearly the beginning, I
          held roles from fixing bugs to leading the entire engineering
          team of 24 members and everything in between. I helped execute
          projects and build processes that supported our work as the
          Harvest team grew from 4 to 60 members. </p>
        <h2> <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208135016/http://coopapp.com/">Co-op</a>
        </h2>
        <p> (Retired) A private online discussion area for your team to
          share short messages. We developed Co-op at Harvest to give
          our distributed team a bit of a watercooler to gather around.
          An interesting shared cache solution was built to integrate
          with Harvest at as high a speed as possible. </p>
        <h2> <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119084738/http://followcost.com/">Follow
            Cost</a> </h2>
        <p> (Retired) Built with <a href="http://luke.francl.org/">Luke
            Francl</a>, Follow Cost measured how frequently people
          tweet. This helped you make informed choices about who to
          follow on Twitter. Fun not only due to its usefulness, but
          also my first chance to experiment with <a
            href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>. I also created
          a <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131105175505/http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/42691">userscript</a>
          to bring Follow Cost into the Twitter web UI. </p>
        <h2> <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150315040002/http://scorebooker.com/">Scorebooker</a>
        </h2>
        <p> (Retired) I enjoy playing softball in the summer and I found
          managing the bits and pieces tedious. Scorebooker was an
          elegant way to quickly enter stats and schedules for your
          team. Rails helped me build this site quickly, and jQuery
          provided fine-tuning for user interactions. </p>
        <h2> <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101005171044/http://scrawlers.com/">Scrawlers</a>
        </h2>
        <p> (Retired) My first Rails app, Scrawlers was built as a
          combination learning project and personal passion. I partnered
          with <a href="http://thelifemosaic.com">Nate Melcher</a> to
          build this online writing workshop focused on 100-word
          stories. It was a great way to learn Rails. Though the
          business-side of things failed, it was also useful to
          experience running an app with real customers and real usage
          demands. </p>
