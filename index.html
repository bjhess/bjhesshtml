    <p>
      I am one Barry Hess. It turns out there are many in this world, and I am one. Minnesota is where I have resided
      for most of my life, and it is probably where I'll be for most of the rest of my life.

      I try to write every day. My writing can be found on my <a href="/blog/" class="highlight">blog</a>, secret poetry
      blog, <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com">microblog</a>, <a href="https://buttondown.email/bjhess">personal
        newsletter</a>, <a href="https://goodenoughnews.substack.com">A Good Enough newsletter</a>, journal entries, and
      sometimes in the logs of <a href="https://doevery.day/bjhess" class="highlight">doevery.day</a>. I also keep a
      commonplace book for my own amusement, tracking things like <a href="/commonplace/watches/2022/">watches</a>, <a
        href="/commonplace/listens/">listens</a>, <a href="/commonplace/reads/">reads</a>, and <a
        href="/commonplace/">more</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Years ago I acted all serious and helped build <a href="https://www.getharvest.com">Harvest</a>, but to be honest
      I've always been happiest <a href="/projects/">goofing off</a> on the web. These days I like to do work that is
      <a href="https://good-enough.us" class="highlight">good enough</a>.
      Sometimes I'll take a break from writing and interneting to do a little <a
        href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2021/11/21/projects-of-great.html">woodworking</a>.
