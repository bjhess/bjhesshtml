    <p>
      I am one Barry Hess. It turns out there are many in this world, and I am one. Minnesota is where I have resided
      for most of my life, and it is probably where I'll be for most of the rest of my life.
    </p>

    <p>
      I try to write every day. My writing can be found on my <a href="/blog/">blog</a>, secret poetry blog, <a
        href="link">microblog</a>, <a href="https://buttondown.email/bjhess">newsletter</a>, journal entries, and
      sometimes in the logs of <a href="https://doevery.day/bjhess">doevery.day</a>. I also keep a <a
        href="/commonplace">commonplace
        book</a> for my own amusement.
    </p>

    <p>
      On most days I work a little on <a href="http://doevery.day">internet madness</a>. Sometimes I'll take a break
      from writing and interneting to do a little woodworking. Years ago I helped build <a
        href="https://www.getharvest.com">Harvest</a>, and I've always been one to <a href="/projects">goof off</a> on
      the web.
