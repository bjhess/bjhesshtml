        Now
      </h1>

      <p>
        What am I up to?
      </p>

<h3>Work</h3>
<p>Last winter Shawn and I surprised ourselves when we started to work on software again. This winter we are baffling
  ourselves again by stepping up our commitment to being <a href="https://goodenough.us/">Good Enough</a>. We are moving
  the studio from a place to have fun with tiny projects to a place that builds a few products with the goal to become a
  self-sustaining business.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have <a href="https://matthewlettini.com/">Matthew Lettini</a> on board. For a few weeks now he's
  been absolutely blasting <a href="https://albumwhale.com/">Album Whale</a> into orbit. It's felt great to be improving
  that product at such a rapid pace.</p>
<p>This week we started working on our next product. This is a product we need to use, and a product that will generate
  revenue. We're just getting going, but making steady progress.</p>
<p>And we need more help! We have two job posts up that we're getting ready to share. If you want to get a flavor of
  what we're hoping Good Enough grows into, these posts say some more:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://goodenough.us/jobs/senior-developer-rails/">Senior Developer - Rails</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://goodenough.us/jobs/senior-developer-javascript/">Senior Developer - JavaScript</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>Much like <a
    href="https://bjhess.com/then/2022-11-29/">my last update</a>, school activities have been busy. Wait, actually, why did I say that in the last update?
  The middle and youngest are much more busy now!</p>
<p>The youngest is in gymnastics, and competition season has been these past few months. She's also been doing music
  things, transitioning from baritone to tuba and performing a few ensembles at the recent district contest. The middle
  is in: concert band, solo &amp; ensemble, jazz band, musical pit orchestra, winter drumline, student council,
  knowledge bowl, and robotics. (I'm certain I missed something.) What is she thinking?! :)</p>
<p>The oldest is back to college for spring semester. While her winter break started off with some rocky things, it
  seemed like she really enjoyed being home for an extended stay. I think it was an over-five-week break! At college
  she's been enjoying pep band, concert band, student alumni association, and a kpop club in the city. She also took a
  car with her and has loved exploring more of the city.</p>
<p>Jesse and I work together to try to keep everyone, including ourselves, happy. I've found this winter to be quite
  hard. I've started feeling old for the first time in my life. While <a
    href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books"><em>Four Thousand Weeks</em></a> was a great book, I'm still at some
  mid-point stage of leveling with the fact that, well, I'm not going to do everything I'd hoped to do before I expire.
  I think this is a freeing way to think about one's priorities, but I'm not quite fully at peace with it yet. Soon!</p>
<p>In the positive spirit of the above paragraph, I hope my next update tells you about some good changes I've made in
  my habits. I hope it shows that I'm feeling healthier and upbeat. I hope you'll be able to see me living into the
  priorities I've set for myself. And I hope all of the same for you!</p>
