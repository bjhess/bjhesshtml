        What am I up to?
      </p>

      <h2>Home</h2>

      <p>
        We have one kid graduating in June, so a large part of these final school months are preparing to celebrate her
        graduation. There have also been a myriad of activities and bow-tyings related to graduation and college in the
        fall. Alongside that are the billions of activities her sisters are in. And the summer brings marching band
        season. We're busy!
      </p>

      <p>
        Winter and spring were very long here, with spring being unusually cold and incredibly windy. I am happy that
        summer seems to be arriving. We have plans to take a couple trips (Orlando with the marching band and southern
        Utah for some hiking). We're excited to spend a lot of time together this summer!

        And the house is getting new shingles soon.

      <h2>Work</h2>

      <p>
        Earlier this year <a href="https://www.mrshawnliu.com/">Shawn</a> and I fell into a surprising rhythm of
        building software prototypes. We formed <a href="https://good-enough.us/">Good Enough LLC</a> on April 1st to be
        the space from which we do our work. Recently we have publicly released:

      </ul>

      <p>
        I've been coding in Ruby on Rails. I <a href="/blog/2022/trying-phoenix-and-elixir/">tried Elixir and
          Phoenix</a>, but it didn't quite take. I should write about that at some point. I've also been diving back
        into making straight HTML+CSS pages, including updating this very website to be just that. No, I'm not even
        using a static-site generator.
