      <p>
        What am I up to?
      </p>

      <h2>Home</h2>

      <p>
        Our summer has been filled with marching band, marching band trips, and a lovely trip to Utah.
        Activities have slowed down here in the last third of the summer.
      </p>


      <p>
        Our oldest daughter has graduated high school and will be heading to college in the fall.
        We are kind of sitting around and waiting for our family to be split apart.
        It's an odd feeling.
      </p>

      <h2>Work</h2>

      <p>
        I continue to write my <a href="https://buttondown.email/bjhess">monthly newsletter</a>, as well as at my
        <a href="/blog">blog</a>.
        I'm trying to write at the blog more in August.
        Work on <a href="https://good-enough.us">Good Enough</a> has slowed for the summer.
        <a href="https://doevery.day/bjhess">doevery.day</a> seems to take care of itself while we're away.
        We'll pick some work back up in the fall.
        We'll probably resume <a href="https://goodenoughnews.substack.com/">A Good Enough Newsletter</a> then as well.
