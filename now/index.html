<p>What's going on now?</p>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>It has been three months since my last update, and since then quite a bit has happened. Primarily a few more people have joined us at <a href="https://goodenough.us/">Good Enough</a>! Arun, Patrick, and <a href="http://lazyatom.com/">James</a>, specifically. Yes, this means that during my time at Harvest I worked in some capacity with almost our entire Good Enough team. James is the new, very even-keeled wildcard in that mix. <a href="https://goodenoughnews.substack.com/p/season-3-issue-3-cosmic-maelstrom">Our recent newsletter</a> talks a bit more about the team.</p>
<p>We also soft launched a little beta of our latest software, <a href="https://ponder.us">Ponder</a>. Ponder is our take on software for private groups or small forums. If you have any groups with whom you'd like an organized, asynchronous way to talk, kick it around and see what you think. And let me know if you have any questions!</p>
<p>That newsletter also talks a tiny bit about our plan for the rest of 2023, which is…I guess subscribe to that newsletter to find out!</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>We are keeping busy as always.</p>
<p>The school year is racing toward a close. The middlest's activities have slowed down a bit. We're looking forward to a pops concert tomorrow night, followed by marching band season. The youngest is also in marching band, and continues to enjoy playing traveling soccer. The oldest is back home for the summer. She has picked up her first traditional pay-per-hour job and is looking forward to starting it this week.</p>
<p>Jesse and I have started a new nutrition and exercise program. We are on our sixth week. It has been going pretty well as we are gaining some much needed strength, while hopefully losing body fat. (One of us is having a little more luck with the weight loss portion – both of us would like to see those changes follow on as well!) We hope to keep the momentum and continue building new habits that stick.</p>
<p>In general I am more upbeat than my last update, and that feels good. The biggest habit change that our program espouses is sleep. This week I've felt like I'm starting to turn the corner on a years-long sleep struggle. I hope it continues!</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the exciting summer we have planned. The biggest event being a trip to Japan and South Korea. So much planning. So much preparing. We're all pumped!</p>
<p>As always, if you would rather update <em>your</em> personal /now page by replying to me and telling me what you're up to, I'm all ears!</p>
