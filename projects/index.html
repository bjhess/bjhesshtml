      </h2>
      <p>
        My friends Shawn, Patrick, and I had a desire to keep track of the albums we were listening, as well as
        keeping track of the albums we wanted to try. We set out to automate all of this while building
        a small network of people who wanted the same. We're hopeful this will lead to all kinds of fun
        discovery of new music!

        Shawn and I put together a website to help us stay motivated to do the daily thing we like to do to
        keep
        ourselves happy. We built it for us to go after creative pursuits like drawing and writing. It's a sort of
        Seinfeld
        calendar with a log. And a little fun built in.

      </h2>
      <p>
        Parking on the street during the winter can be quite a challenge. There are rules that I don't understand, the
        rules
        are somewhat hard to follow, and my brain gets lost. This website makes it simple to load a page and park where
        it
        tells you to park.

      <h2>
        <a href='https://www.getharvest.com'>Harvest</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        From 2007 to 2019 I was part of an elite team at Harvest building the best time tracking and invoicing software
        on the
        planet. Being part of the team from nearly the beginning, I held roles from fixing bugs to leading the entire
        engineering team of 24 members and everything in between. I helped execute projects and build processes that
        supported
        our work as the Harvest team grew from 4 to 60 members.

      <h2>
        <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20160208135016/http://coopapp.com/'>Co-op</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        (Retired) A private online discussion area for your team to share short messages. We developed Co-op at Harvest
        to
        give our distributed team a bit of a watercooler to gather around. An interesting shared cache solution was
        built to
        integrate with Harvest at as high a speed as possible.
      </p>



      <h2>
        <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20120119084738/http://followcost.com/'>Follow Cost</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        (Retired) Built with <a href="http://luke.francl.org/">Luke Francl</a>, Follow Cost measured how frequently
        people
        tweet. This helped you make informed choices about who to follow on Twitter. Fun not only due to its usefulness,
        but
        also my first chance to experiment with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>. I also created a <a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131105175505/http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/42691">userscript</a> to
        bring
        Follow Cost into the Twitter web UI.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20150315040002/http://scorebooker.com/'>Scorebooker</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        (Retired) I enjoy playing softball in the summer and I found managing the bits and pieces tedious. Scorebooker
        was an
        elegant way to quickly enter stats and schedules for your team. Rails helped me build this site quickly, and
        jQuery
        provided fine-tuning for user interactions.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20101005171044/http://scrawlers.com/'>Scrawlers</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        (Retired) My first Rails app, Scrawlers was built as a combination learning project and personal passion. I
        partnered
        with <a href="http://thelifemosaic.com">Nate Melcher</a> to build this online writing workshop focused on
        100-word
        stories. It was a great way to learn Rails. Though the business-side of things failed, it was also useful to
        experience running an app with real customers and real usage demands.
