I like to build things. I've managed people as well. It's possible
I might want to do it again.


WORK HISTORY

2022-present	Good Enough, LLC (https://good-enough.us)
Co-founded Good Enough with Shawn Liu. We've built multiple niche
web services.

1997-present	Doing My Own Thing (https://bjhess.com/projects/)
Since becoming entangled in the web, I have built personal and side
projects. I have built sites to help writers write and players keep
track of stats. I have built sites that track Twitter noise and sites
for keeping track of winter parking. Lots of sites!

2007-2019		Harvest (https://getharvest.com)
I helped build Harvest into one of the top time tracking and invoicing
applications in the world! I started as a programmer, one of four
builders of the initial application. By the time I left the company,
I was the Director of Engineering, helping the engineering department
grow to over 25 people successfully delivering improvements every day.

2000-2007		Federated Insurance
As a programmer/analyst, I grew in my skillset both as a programmer and
as a teammate. Eventually I progressed to a Java Language Specialist
role, where I helped Java programmers throughout the company solve
problems while also supporting our Spring-like internally-built
Java framework.

1998-2000		Bay Technology Group
My primary work was building and supporting the Daktronics, Inc. website
as well as the Bay Technology Group website.
