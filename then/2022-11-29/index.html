        What am I up to?
      </p>

      <h2>Home</h2>

      <p>
        Our fall has been busy with school activities. This included many travels to events at our
        oldest's college. It has been challenging for all of us to be apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been lightly thinking about consumption.
        I would like an ongoing log of the things I've consumed here.
        It is too tedious to keep up with it on the HTML-only web site I've built.
        But building new blog software also sounds a bit silly.
      </p>

      <h2>Work</h2>

      <p>
        I continue to write my <a href="https://buttondown.email/bjhess">monthly newsletter</a>.
        I haven't been <a href="/blog">blogging</a> as much.
        Work on <a href="https://goodenough.us">Good Enough</a> has picked back up for the fall.
        <a href="https://doevery.day/bjhess">doevery.day</a> has not been a primary focus.
        We recently launched <a href="https://albumwhale.com">Album Whale</a> and we're excited to see how it grows.
        <a href="https://goodenoughnews.substack.com/">A Good Enough Newsletter</a> has been on hiatus.
        Our updates can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/goodenoughllc">Twitter</a>.
