        Travelogues: South Utah ('22)
      </h1>

      <p>
        Traveling to some number of the Mighty Five Utah national parks has been on our list for some time.
        We've always been concerned about visiting those parks in the summer because the heat can get to be extreme.
        Thankfully this year we found ourselves pushed to just give it a go.
      </p>

      <p>
        The driver of this trip wasn't actually the destination, but rather a need to use some expiring airline
        miles.
        In 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, we had to cancel a spring break trip to Florida at the last minute.
        When we did that the airline provided us with miles to use at a later date, which was a nice outcome all things
        considered.
      </p>

      <p>
        It wasn't until over a year later that we finally booked those miles, picking the same Florida destination as a
        spring break trip.
        However, within a week of that booking we discovered a more affordable flight on the same airline.
        When we rebooked at nearly half the cost, we had miles back in our pocket to spend, but this time with more
        stipulations.
        These miles could be booked for any destination, but once we locked in that destination we could only modify the
        flights for that same destination.
        Switching destinations would mean losing these credits.
      </p>

      <p>
        So for this booking we narrowed things down to destinations that would have flights on this (smallish)
        airline all year 'round.
        This would guarantee that if we decided not to do another vacation in 2022, we could kick the vacation down the
        road to a later date.
        Las Vegas is a place that <em>always</em> has flights, and it is the closest major airport to Zion National
        Park, so we booked it!
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end we decided to not only keep that Vegas booking, but extend the schedule by a couple of days to allow
        us more time in Utah.
        We've done a lot of travel this year, but we were happy to make sure we got one more big family trip with our
        oldest daughter who is off to college in the fall.
        We were also thankful that we extended the trip.
        Even with the added days we could have still kept busy for a week longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're thinking of traveling to the national parks of southern Utah, I say you should do it.
        Perhaps this travelogue will help you in making your plans. If you'd like to talk, please feel free to

        Day 1: We Fly
      </h2>

      <p>
        We flew out of the sleepy Terminal 2 (n√©e Humphrey Terminal) in Minneapolis.
        Our flight was originally to arrive in Las Vegas around noon, but the day prior it had already been pushed back
        a few hours.
        We were a bit anxious to be leaving Las Vegas (heh) during rush hour rather than sleepy noontime traffic.
        In the end it was all fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        The flight went well.
        Our drive out included a stop at In-N-Out Burger, which none of us had ever been to.
        We don't generally like fast food as part of our vacations because it just kind of bogs you down.
        With a daughter who is a burger lover, though, we had to stop.
        We ordered animal style this and double-double that.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-1/IMG_2518.jpg" alt="In-N-Out Burger" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Our favorite part of the drive was cutting through the <a
          href="https://www.shltrip.com/Virgini_River_Gorge.html">Virgin River Gorge</a>.
        As we approached the Beaver Dam Mountains, I asked, "Where are we <em>going</em>?"
        I expected the interstate to continue north or northeast alongside the range, but I could not see any roadway
        ahead.
        We moved closer and I suggested, "Maybe we're going through the mountains?"
        Sure enough, that was the plan.
        I later learned the highway through this gorge was one of the most expensive ever built.
        Cliffs surrounded us and we occaisionally got a peek at the Virgin River, the waterway that also carved out most
        of our primary destination, Zion National Park.
        The walls of the gorge were spectacular, and a bit dizzying as the rock layers ran at a different angle than the
        road.
      </p>

      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        The drive to our homebase in Kanab, Utah, was three-and-a-half hours.
        With our delayed flight, it did mean we finished up in the dark, which always adds a touch of anxiety in a new
        place.
        Thankfully everything went fine.
        It was incredibly dark in Kanab as we drove through to find our rental home.
        Clearly they have some light pollution laws in effect.
      </p>

      <h2 id="day-2">
        Day 2: Dunes &amp; Caves
      </h2>

      <p>
        We woke up at a reasonable time and loaded our bags with sandwiches, snacks, and water.
        Oh, the water!
        The two mantras for this trip were: Stay Hydrated and Start Early.
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting early was useful in multiple ways.
        First, you could beat the crowds to some destinations.
        Zion especially gets lots of visitors, and the earlier you get on a trail, the less busy it is.
        I personally don't plan a trip to explore nature with a desire to explore it with 100 other people I don't know
        crowded around me.
        So, yes, I'm no morning person, but earlier was better on this trip.
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly, an early start meant you beat the weather.
        Beating the heat was the primary concern.
        As days rose into the 100 degree range, you would wish you had started earlier.
        Toward the end of our trip afternoon thunderstorms became a common occurrence.
        Getting up early helped you get in most of a day before the storms chased you back to cover.
      </p>

      <p>
        Staying hydrated was critical.
        We traveled with a <a
          href="https://www.rei.com/search?q=hydration+backpacks&ir=q%3Ahydration+backpacks&r=category%3Acamping-and-hiking">hydration
          backpack</a> for each of us
        I know it can get expensive to do this for a family, but I would say it is a <em>must</em> for any trips with
        hikes longer than a mile or two.
        It allows you to pack the necessary amount of water in a way that carries much easier than bottles.
        And it allows you to drink from a convenient hose while hiking, avoiding the slow-downs of fumbling with
        grabbing water from your pack.
      </p>

      <p>
        On this day we were starting light and local.
        Our destination was <a href="https://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/coral-pink/">Coral Pink Sand Dunes State
          Park</a>, just under thirty minutes from our homebase.
        Our plan was to hike on the dunes and perhaps rent a sled for a bizarre (to us northerners) sand sledding
        experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The environment was surreal, with these sand dunes nestled amongst the surrounding hills.
        We all sledded down at least once, with a couple of the girls trying twice.
        The walk up the large dunes was an incredible workout.
        Each of us felt some level of sick at some point.
        The heat and exercise certainly contributed, but I also think we weren't yet used to the altitude.
        It was a fun site to see, but don't plan on spending more than a couple of hours here.
      </p>

      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-2/IMG_2541.jpg" alt="Ready to sled" />
      </p>

      <p>
        At one point I walked across the top of a dune away from the rest of the family.
        I could see that if I kept going I'd arrive where no one (today) had yet walked, though it turns out some other
        animals had found the place before me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-2/IMG_2549.jpg" alt="First footprints" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, we stopped at a couple of man-made destinations.
        The first of these was <a
          href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57030-d17370729-Reviews-Belly_of_the_Dragon-Kanab_Utah.html">Belly
          of the Dragon</a>. It's a pretty cool tunnel that only takes twenty or thirty minutes to explore. It's worth
        quick stop if it's on your way.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-2/IMG_9702.jpg" alt="Belly of the Dragon" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally we wanted to explore <a href="https://utahhikingbeauty.com/kanab-sand-caves/">Sand Caves</a>, which I
        believe are remains of a glass mining operation.
        We set out from the parking lot, which is a mile or so south of <a href="https://www.moqui-cave.com">Moqui
          Cave</a>, which I mention because we weren't sure at the time if you hiked from Moqui or some other place.
        Sand Caves does have it's own parking lot.
        You set off from this parking lot back north for a supposed half-mile hike before ascending toward the caves.
      </p>

      <p>
        This became an adventure beyond what we expected.
        The day had gotten easily over 100 degrees and we were getting quite hot.
        We had plenty of water and snacks, but the half-mile sure felt longer than that.
        The trail kept going and going, closer to the mountain where the caves were carved, then farther away, then
        back.
        We had passed the caves and figuerd we would find a gradual climb ahead to get back to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        And we did find that gradual climb!
        It had to be nearly a mile from where we started, however, so it didn't feel right.
        We climbed up a bit and started following a trail back to the south.
        We met some other hikers who said, "Don't go that way unless you want to cling to the side of a mountain to get
        to the caves."
        Okay!
        So we found an even higher route and kept walking.
        Until we were above the caves, which were maybe 1,000 feet in front of us.
        So we found a scramble down, and it wasn't the most comfortable way to get there.
        We did get there, though!
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-2/IMG_2553.jpg" alt="Cave dwellers" />
      </p>

      <p>
        As we left the caves to find our way back to parking, we watched some other hikers climb down the side of the
        mountain on bare rock.
        We also met some hikers and asked how they had gotten up ‚Äì bare rock was their path as well.
        It turns out we had just walked right past a fairly steep climb up rock to a trail that was veritcally level
        with the caves.
        Our exit followed this "path," though it was challenging to find a way down that felt safe.
      </p>

      <p>
        That turned out to be enough adventure for us for the day.
        Back to homebase for dinner and rest.
