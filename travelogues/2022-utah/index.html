        Travelogues: South Utah ('22)
      </h1>

      <p>
        Traveling to some number of the Mighty Five Utah national parks has been on our list for some time.
        We've always been concerned about visiting those parks in the summer because the heat can get to be extreme.
        Thankfully this year we found ourselves pushed to just give it a go.
      </p>

      <p>
        The driver of this trip wasn't actually the destination, but rather a need to use some expiring airline
        miles.
        In 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, we had to cancel a spring break trip to Florida at the last minute.
        When we did that the airline provided us with miles to use at a later date, which was a nice outcome all things
        considered.
      </p>

      <p>
        It wasn't until over a year later that we finally booked those miles, picking the same Florida destination as a
        spring break trip.
        However, within a week of that booking we discovered a more affordable flight on the same airline.
        When we rebooked at nearly half the cost, we had miles back in our pocket to spend, but this time with more
        stipulations.
        These miles could be booked for any destination, but once we locked in that destination we could only modify the
        flights for that same destination.
        Switching destinations would mean losing these credits.
      </p>

      <p>
        So for this booking we narrowed things down to destinations that would have flights on this (smallish)
        airline all year 'round.
        This would guarantee that if we decided not to do another vacation in 2022, we could kick the vacation down the
        road to a later date.
        Las Vegas is a place that <em>always</em> has flights, and it is the closest major airport to Zion National
        Park, so we booked it!
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end we decided to not only keep that Vegas booking, but extend the schedule by a couple of days to allow
        us more time in Utah.
        We've done a lot of travel this year, but we were happy to make sure we got one more big family trip with our
        oldest daughter who is off to college in the fall.
        We were also thankful that we extended the trip.
        Even with the added days we could have still kept busy for a week longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're thinking of traveling to the national parks of southern Utah, I say you should do it.
        Perhaps this travelogue will help you in making your plans. If you'd like to talk, please feel free to

      <h2 id="day-1">
        Day 1: We Fly
      </h2>

      <p>
        We flew out of the sleepy Terminal 2 (née Humphrey Terminal) in Minneapolis.
        Our flight was originally to arrive in Las Vegas around noon, but the day prior it had already been pushed back
        a few hours.
        We were a bit anxious to be leaving Las Vegas (heh) during rush hour rather than sleepy noontime traffic.
        In the end it was all fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        The flight went well.
        Our drive out included a stop at In-N-Out Burger, which none of us had ever been to.
        We don't generally like fast food as part of our vacations because it just kind of bogs you down.
        With a daughter who is a burger lover, though, we had to stop.
        We ordered animal style this and double-double that.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-1/IMG_2518.jpg" alt="In-N-Out Burger" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Our favorite part of the drive was cutting through the <a
          href="https://www.shltrip.com/Virgini_River_Gorge.html">Virgin River Gorge</a>.
        As we approached the Beaver Dam Mountains, I asked, "Where are we <em>going</em>?"
        I expected the interstate to continue north or northeast alongside the range, but I could not see any roadway
        ahead.
        We moved closer and I suggested, "Maybe we're going through the mountains?"
        Sure enough, that was the plan.
        I later learned the highway through this gorge was one of the most expensive ever built.
        Cliffs surrounded us and we occaisionally got a peek at the Virgin River, the waterway that also carved out most
        of our primary destination, Zion National Park.
        The walls of the gorge were spectacular, and a bit dizzying as the rock layers ran at a different angle than the
        road.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-1/IMG_9586.jpg" alt="Virgin River Gorge" />
      </p>

      <p>
        The drive to our homebase in Kanab, Utah, was three-and-a-half hours.
        With our delayed flight, it did mean we finished up in the dark, which always adds a touch of anxiety in a new
        place.
        Thankfully everything went fine.
        It was incredibly dark in Kanab as we drove through to find our rental home.
        Clearly they have some light pollution laws in effect.
      </p>

      <h2 id="day-2">
        Day 2: Dunes &amp; Caves
      </h2>

      <p>
        We woke up at a reasonable time and loaded our bags with sandwiches, snacks, and water.
        Oh, the water!
        The two mantras for this trip were: Stay Hydrated and Start Early.
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting early was useful in multiple ways.
        First, you could beat the crowds to some destinations.
        Zion especially gets lots of visitors, and the earlier you get on a trail, the less busy it is.
        I personally don't plan a trip to explore nature with a desire to explore it with 100 other people I don't know
        crowded around me.
        So, yes, I'm no morning person, but earlier was better on this trip.
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly, an early start meant you beat the weather.
        Beating the heat was the primary concern.
        As days rose into the 100 degree range, you would wish you had started earlier.
        Toward the end of our trip afternoon thunderstorms became a common occurrence.
        Getting up early helped you get in most of a day before the storms chased you back to cover.
      </p>

      <p>
        Staying hydrated was critical.
        We traveled with a <a
          href="https://www.rei.com/search?q=hydration+backpacks&ir=q%3Ahydration+backpacks&r=category%3Acamping-and-hiking">hydration
          backpack</a> for each of us
        I know it can get expensive to do this for a family, but I would say it is a <em>must</em> for any trips with
        hikes longer than a mile or two.
        It allows you to pack the necessary amount of water in a way that carries much easier than bottles.
        And it allows you to drink from a convenient hose while hiking, avoiding the slow-downs of fumbling with
        grabbing water from your pack.
      </p>

      <p>
        On this day we were starting light and local.
        Our destination was <a href="https://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/coral-pink/">Coral Pink Sand Dunes State
          Park</a>, just under thirty minutes from our homebase.
        Our plan was to hike on the dunes and perhaps rent a sled for a bizarre (to us northerners) sand sledding
        experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The environment was surreal, with these sand dunes nestled amongst the surrounding hills.
        We all sledded down at least once, with a couple of the girls trying twice.
        The walk up the large dunes was an incredible workout.
        Each of us felt some level of sick at some point.
        The heat and exercise certainly contributed, but I also think we weren't yet used to the altitude.
        It was a fun site to see, but don't plan on spending more than a couple of hours here.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-2/IMG_2522.jpg" alt="Sledding in the sand" />
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-2/IMG_2536.jpg" alt="Sledding if you dare!" />
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-2/IMG_2541.jpg" alt="Ready to sled" />
      </p>

      <p>
        At one point I walked across the top of a dune away from the rest of the family.
        I could see that if I kept going I'd arrive where no one (today) had yet walked, though it turns out some other
        animals had found the place before me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-2/IMG_2549.jpg" alt="First footprints" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, we stopped at a couple of man-made destinations.
        The first of these was <a
          href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57030-d17370729-Reviews-Belly_of_the_Dragon-Kanab_Utah.html">Belly
          of the Dragon</a>. It's a pretty cool tunnel that only takes twenty or thirty minutes to explore. It's worth
        quick stop if it's on your way.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-2/IMG_9702.jpg" alt="Belly of the Dragon" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally we wanted to explore <a href="https://utahhikingbeauty.com/kanab-sand-caves/">Sand Caves</a>, which I
        believe are remains of a glass mining operation.
        We set out from the parking lot, which is a mile or so south of <a href="https://www.moqui-cave.com">Moqui
          Cave</a>, which I mention because we weren't sure at the time if you hiked from Moqui or some other place.
        Sand Caves does have it's own parking lot.
        You set off from this parking lot back north for a supposed half-mile hike before ascending toward the caves.
      </p>

      <p>
        This became an adventure beyond what we expected.
        The day had gotten easily over 100 degrees and we were getting quite hot.
        We had plenty of water and snacks, but the half-mile sure felt longer than that.
        The trail kept going and going, closer to the mountain where the caves were carved, then farther away, then
        back.
        We had passed the caves and figuerd we would find a gradual climb ahead to get back to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        And we did find that gradual climb!
        It had to be nearly a mile from where we started, however, so it didn't feel right.
        We climbed up a bit and started following a trail back to the south.
        We met some other hikers who said, "Don't go that way unless you want to cling to the side of a mountain to get
        to the caves."
        Okay!
        So we found an even higher route and kept walking.
        Until we were above the caves, which were maybe 1,000 feet in front of us.
        So we found a scramble down, and it wasn't the most comfortable way to get there.
        We did get there, though!
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-2/IMG_2553.jpg" alt="Cave dwellers" />
      </p>

      <p>
        As we left the caves to find our way back to parking, we watched some other hikers climb down the side of the
        mountain on bare rock.
        We also met some hikers and asked how they had gotten up – bare rock was their path as well.
        It turns out we had just walked right past a fairly steep climb up rock to a trail that was veritcally level
        with the caves.
        Our exit followed this "path," though it was challenging to find a way down that felt safe.
      </p>

      <p>
        That turned out to be enough adventure for us for the day.
        Back to homebase for dinner and rest.
      </p>

      <h2 id="day-3">
        Day 3: Zion Proper
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the weeks leading up to this trip we had decided to attempt hiking <a
          href="https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/lowersubway.php">The Subway</a>.
        This is a permitted hike.
        I cannot tell how many people are permitted to the hike each day, but it seems to be well under 100.
        We hadn't planned far enough in advance and missed the <a
          href="https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/thesubway.htm">two-month advance lottery</a>.
        So just before departure and as we arrived on our vacation, I was signing us up for the daily lottery that is
        used to distributed the remaining twenty group hiking openings.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were fortunate enough to win the lottery eventually, securing entry to The Subway for day four (Saturday).
        The downside is, as much as I had begged, you must visit a park ranger at one of the two visitors centers in
        order to procure your permit.
        I had read <a href="https://rootofgood.com/utah-bryce-canyon-zion-road-trip/">horror stories</a> about the
        lengthy traffic delays on the switchback roads within the park.
        But there was no going around it, so in we went planning to have most of our day be sitting in the car and
        looking at the surroundings.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-3/IMG_9796.jpg" alt="Checkerboard Mesa" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Entering the park from the east, we were greeted with spectacular views early and often, quickly making our way
        past Checkerboard Mesa.
        We left our homebase early enough that we hoped to beat the crowds to the <a
          href="https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/canyonoverlook.php">Canyon Overlook Trail</a>, which would be a
        fairly easy trek to a nice view.
        We got lucky and grabbed one of the last parking spots on the north side of the road just before the east
        tunnel.
        Up we went!
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-3/IMG_2569.jpg" alt="Half-tunnels on Canyon Overlook Trail" />

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-3/IMG_9804.jpg" alt="On the Canyon Overlook Trail" />
      </p>

      <p>
        The view was something else!
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-3/IMG_2556.jpg" alt="Canyon Overlook" />

      <p>
        <img src="images/day-3/IMG_9846.jpg" alt="Canyon Overlook with family obscurring" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Next we travelled through the cool, mile-long eastern tunnel.
        We arrived at the dreaded switchback road and...
        it was fine!
        Traffic was not a problem at all, rendering my pre-worrying moot.
        I must keep reminding myself to be prepared for such things, but don't worry about them until it's necessary.
        The only problem here was keeping the vehicle on the road while craning our heads looking at all the gorgeous
        views.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the main visitors center more luck found us when we grabbed a parking spot right up front as someone else was
        leaving.
        It looked to me like the parking lot was actually full, so we certainly were fortunate.
        I went to pick up our Subway permit while the rest of the family hung out in the vehicle and ate lunch.
        We figured we'd depart for a hike elsewhere in the park after this work was done.
      </p>
      <p>
        I walked right up to the ranger window and had a nice fifteen minute talk with the ranger.
        I learned that the reason for an in-person pick up was certainly so the ranger could size up our group and
        determine how much they should encourage us not to go on the hike.
        We talked about water needs, flash flooding, temperatures, solid waste plans, and so much more.
        I needed to sign off on a paper that again reitrated all the requirements and risks of the hike.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leaving that meeting, I looked over at the shuttle line and I was surprised.
        In the summer, the main north-south road through Zion is not driveable for those entering the park for day use.
        A shuttle system is used to transport folks up the canyon to famous hikes like <a
          href="https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/angelslanding.php">Angels Landing</a> and <a
          href="https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/zionnarrows.php">The
          Narrows</a>
        I had read horror stories, similar to those about the switchback road, that this line to board the shuttle could
        be hours long.
        Yet what I saw was hardly a line at all.
        People seemed to be walking right on to the shuttle.
      </p>

      <p>
        So our plans changed.
        Rather than driving out of the park proper and trying the <a
          href="https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/eastmesatrail.php">East Mesa Trail</a>, which seemed like a pretty
        big hike to do right before Subway, we decided to hop on the shuttle.
        While we were not prepared to go on The Narrows hike, we did have chacos and felt like maybe we could do a
        little bit of the walk-through-water.
      </p>

      <p>
        So ride we did.
        The shuttle was fully-seated, with standing-room-only being used for a couple stops.
        Not too long after boarding we arrived at the human zoo that is The Zion Narrows.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think we were all very glad to be able to visit this cool hike through cool water.
        It's a bit of a walk before you enter the water, and there are lots of people on the trail.
        Chacos are not the appropriate footwear as they slow you down (they catch water like a sail as you wade) and
        they require you to be very cautious with the large rocks unseen below your feet.
        I think we all would like to visit that hike with the appropriate time available and gear rented.
        Once we hit the water, we probably hiked in for about an hour.
        It was really amazing and we can imagine it gets even more amazing as you go further up the narrowing canyon to
        escape the less-committed hikers.
      </p>

        <img src="images/day-3/IMG_9939.jpg" alt="Zion Narrows" />
      </p>

      <p>
        With a 3:45 A.M. wakeup call for the next day, we packed it in fairly early.
        We drove back to our homebase, loaded up our packs for the morning, and retired for some much-needed sleep.
