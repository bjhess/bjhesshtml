        Travelogues: Chicago ('23)
      </h1>

<p>A few weeks ago we all went to the Chicago area for a long weekend. Truthfully we never got into the Chicago city limits, but it was still a lovely trip.</p>
<p>My daughters spent one night at a concert for their <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/bts-star-suga-named-nba-ambassador">favorite NBA  Ambassador</a>, which allowed Jesse and I to roll around the area chasing entertainment and food. We went to a movie (the D&amp;D one â€“ it was entertaining enough), got our first restaurant-made  pierogis (way more oily than I imagined), found a weird brewery in an industrial park, and drove out of that brewery parking lot to a lovely restaurant/brewery area in Rosemont (I think).</p>
<p>Earlier that day we walked around Oak Park to look at the tens of <a href="https://chicago.curbed.com/maps/oak-park-frank-lloyd-wright-walking-tour">Frank Lloyd Wright homes</a> in the area. It was a cloudy day where the rain just kept holding off for the most part. We saw houses that were quite obviously from the Prairie School and houses that were from his &quot;bootleg&quot; years, more Victorian in style.</p>
<p>We were reminded that Wright was employed and fired by Louis Sullivan. Sullivan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers%27_Bank_of_Owatonna">designed a bank</a> in our little town. He is generally considered an inspiration to the Prairie School architects.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.flwright.org/tour/home-and-studio">Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio tour</a>. Learning about all of the details that went into building his home and workplace was quite interesting. The upstairs has an impressive, and unusual (RE: suspended piano) homeschool facility. The workspace for architects and artisans to concentrate and collaborate was well-intentioned. The care taken to not have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire">the next fire</a> destroy this burgeoning company's livelihood was well-considered. Wright's office itself was cleverly designed to stand taller than its physical space dictated. Truly impressive!</p>
